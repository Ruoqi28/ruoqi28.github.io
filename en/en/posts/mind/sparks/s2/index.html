But it lacks a unifying framework that explains how these pieces are connected, negotiated, and controlled across scales.\nWe map interactions and draw networks, but we do not ask what rules govern these connections. We describe signal transduction but do not formalize how signals are processed, prioritized, or rejected. We observe molecular interactions but lack a theory of how these interactions form functional decisions within the cell.\nI hate when people say “oh, it’s a chaotic system” — as if that explains anything. Chaos is not an answer. Complexity is not an excuse. Systems that appear chaotic still follow rules, even if we don’t yet understand them.\nIf life is an information system, where are its real mechanisms of information exchange — the rules that govern who talks to whom, when, and how?\nWhat biology calls a “protocol” — an experimental procedure, a fixed assay guideline — is not what I mean. I mean something deeper: the set of rules that govern biological communication itself. The way signals are formatted, recognized, processed, and responded to. Like in communication networks, where a protocol is the invisible system that allows exchange to happen at all.\nThink about how computer networks operate. Every message, every tiny bit of data sent over the internet, follows strict protocols — like TCP/IP — that govern how data is broken into packets, how each packet is labeled, how errors are checked and corrected, how packets are reassembled at the receiving end, and how acknowledgments confirm delivery. Without these protocols, no message would reliably arrive. Even when you load a simple webpage, hundreds of layers of protocols are quietly working to ensure that every bit of information arrives in order, intact, and understood. Every connection is a negotiated transaction, with handshakes, confirmations, and fallback plans if something goes wrong.\nBiology must have something equivalent — systems that define how signals are packaged, recognized, checked, and handled. But we don’t study these rules. We only describe that “A activates B” without asking what makes that activation possible or reliable.\nWhen a cell encounters multiple conflicting signals, how does it decide which to process? When errors occur in signaling, how are they detected and corrected? When pathways overlap, how are conflicts resolved? These are questions about the underlying architecture of life — a set of implicit rules and structures that govern information flow.\nWe have words for this in other fields. Data structures to organize information. Algorithms to process it. Protocols to manage exchange, verification, and correction. Not metaphors — real, functional systems that manage complexity and ensure coherence.\nBiology, for all its data, treats interactions as static facts. But living systems act as if they negotiate, check, and decide — in ways that resemble engineered systems, including distributed networks, communication protocols, and decision algorithms.\nThink of how humans have built machines — computer networks, software layers, distributed systems — that now mimic, perhaps unknowingly, some of life’s complexity. Not because we copied biology, but because when you try to build robust, scalable, fault-tolerant systems, you end up facing the same problems life had to solve. And we solve them using data structures, algorithms, and protocols. In a way, what we build reflects how we were built. The logic we put into our machines mirrors the logic that shapes living systems. Whether consciously or not, as we try to build reliable systems, we repeat what was already there. How people build up systems mirrors how something — or someone — built us.\nConsider signaling. We describe A activates B, B activates C. But we do not ask: under what conditions does A actually activate B? What other inputs block or modify this? What are the required ‘protocol headers’ for that interaction? What confirms success — and what happens if the handshake fails?\nWe study protein-protein interactions as binaries, but they look like structured negotiations: with formatting, confirmation, and potential rejection. Biology has no language for “failed handshakes,” though clearly, signaling often misfires.\nThinking in terms of data structures, algorithms, and protocols could reshape how we study these systems:\nData structures define how biological information is organized — from protein domains to multi-protein complexes to signaling hubs. Algorithms describe how signals are processed — decision-making, amplification, feedback, suppression. Protocols govern the rules of engagement — how molecules recognize, confirm, resolve conflicts, and repair errors. This is not about reducing biology to code. Life has its own logic. But logic, nonetheless — logic we could start to describe, if we looked for it.\nWhat biology lacks is not data. It lacks a framework to understand how information flows, how decisions are made, how systems stay coherent. A theory that sees life as structured, governed, and negotiated.\nA missing theory — not a metaphor.\n","wordCount":"802","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-02-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-02-08T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/en/posts/mind/sparks/s2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"RD's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/img/Q.gif"}}}</script><script type=text/javascript src></script><head><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/custom.css></head><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=/img/rd4.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=/img/rd4.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=/img/rd4.png><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/img/rd4.png></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/ accesskey=h title="RD's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://ruoqi28.github.io/img/rd2.JPEG alt aria-label=logo height=35>RD's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li><li><a href=https://ruoqi28.github.io/zh/ title=中文(简体) aria-label=中文(简体)>中文(简体)</a></li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/search title=" (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span><i class="fa fa-search"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/ title><span><i class="fa fa-home"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/en/posts title=BLOGs><span>BLOGs</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/tags title=TAGs><span>TAGs</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/archives/ title=ARCHIVEs><span>ARCHIVEs</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/links title=LINKs><span>LINKs</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/en/posts/>BLOG</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Systems We Build, Systems We Are</h1><div class=post-meta><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i>&nbsp;2022/02/08
