      <description>Notes on the 2023 TIBS review proposing that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), with their sequence-dependent structural biases, are well-suited to act as sensors and actuators of cellular physicochemistry. Discusses physical principles, molecular mechanisms, and experimental strategies for investigating IDR sensitivity and highlights their potential biological roles.</description>
