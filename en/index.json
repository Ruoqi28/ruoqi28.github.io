But it lacks a unifying framework that explains how these pieces are connected, negotiated, and controlled across scales.\nWe map interactions and draw networks, but we do not ask what rules govern these connections. We describe signal transduction but do not formalize how signals are processed, prioritized, or rejected. We observe molecular interactions but lack a theory of how these interactions form functional decisions within the cell.\nI hate when people say \u0026ldquo;oh, it\u0026rsquo;s a chaotic system\u0026rdquo; — as if that explains anything. Chaos is not an answer. Complexity is not an excuse. Systems that appear chaotic still follow rules, even if we don’t yet understand them.\nIf life is an information system, where are its real mechanisms of information exchange — the rules that govern who talks to whom, when, and how?\nWhat biology calls a \u0026ldquo;protocol\u0026rdquo; — an experimental procedure, a fixed assay guideline — is not what I mean. I mean something deeper: the set of rules that govern biological communication itself. The way signals are formatted, recognized, processed, and responded to. Like in communication networks, where a protocol is the invisible system that allows exchange to happen at all.\nThink about how computer networks operate. Every message, every tiny bit of data sent over the internet, follows strict protocols — like TCP/IP — that govern how data is broken into packets, how each packet is labeled, how errors are checked and corrected, how packets are reassembled at the receiving end, and how acknowledgments confirm delivery. Without these protocols, no message would reliably arrive. Even when you load a simple webpage, hundreds of layers of protocols are quietly working to ensure that every bit of information arrives in order, intact, and understood. Every connection is a negotiated transaction, with handshakes, confirmations, and fallback plans if something goes wrong.\nBiology must have something equivalent — systems that define how signals are packaged, recognized, checked, and handled. But we don\u0026rsquo;t study these rules. We only describe that \u0026ldquo;A activates B\u0026rdquo; without asking what makes that activation possible or reliable.\nWhen a cell encounters multiple conflicting signals, how does it decide which to process? When errors occur in signaling, how are they detected and corrected? When pathways overlap, how are conflicts resolved? These are questions about the underlying architecture of life — a set of implicit rules and structures that govern information flow.\nWe have words for this in other fields. Data structures to organize information. Algorithms to process it. Protocols to manage exchange, verification, and correction. Not metaphors — real, functional systems that manage complexity and ensure coherence.\nBiology, for all its data, treats interactions as static facts. But living systems act as if they negotiate, check, and decide — in ways that resemble engineered systems, including distributed networks, communication protocols, and decision algorithms.\nThink of how humans have built machines — computer networks, software layers, distributed systems — that now mimic, perhaps unknowingly, some of life\u0026rsquo;s complexity. Not because we copied biology, but because when you try to build robust, scalable, fault-tolerant systems, you end up facing the same problems life had to solve. And we solve them using data structures, algorithms, and protocols. In a way, what we build reflects how we were built. The logic we put into our machines mirrors the logic that shapes living systems. Whether consciously or not, as we try to build reliable systems, we repeat what was already there. How people build up systems mirrors how something — or someone — built us.\nConsider signaling. We describe A activates B, B activates C. But we do not ask: under what conditions does A actually activate B? What other inputs block or modify this? What are the required \u0026lsquo;protocol headers\u0026rsquo; for that interaction? What confirms success — and what happens if the handshake fails?\nWe study protein-protein interactions as binaries, but they look like structured negotiations: with formatting, confirmation, and potential rejection. Biology has no language for \u0026ldquo;failed handshakes,\u0026rdquo; though clearly, signaling often misfires.\nThinking in terms of data structures, algorithms, and protocols could reshape how we study these systems:\nData structures define how biological information is organized — from protein domains to multi-protein complexes to signaling hubs. Algorithms describe how signals are processed — decision-making, amplification, feedback, suppression. Protocols govern the rules of engagement — how molecules recognize, confirm, resolve conflicts, and repair errors. This is not about reducing biology to code. Life has its own logic. But logic, nonetheless — logic we could start to describe, if we looked for it.\nWhat biology lacks is not data. It lacks a framework to understand how information flows, how decisions are made, how systems stay coherent. A theory that sees life as structured, governed, and negotiated.\nA missing theory — not a metaphor.\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/en/posts/mind/sparks/s2/","summary":"Not chaos, protocols.","title":"Systems We Build, Systems We Are"},{"content":"What would a biological protocol look like? A biological protocol would be a structured set of rules governing how molecules recognize, interact, and respond to each other. Like a network protocol, it would define formats, expectations, confirmations, and fallback mechanisms. But unlike human-made systems, biological protocols must function in noisy, fluctuating, and hostile environments. They must be robust, flexible, and dynamic — able to adapt to context while still enforcing necessary constraints.\nBiological protocol examples: unpacking real-life cases Example 1: Receptor activation and signal initiation Recognition layer: Ligand-receptor specificity — charge, structure. Handshake: Dimerization, conformational shifts. Execution: Kinase activation, downstream signaling. Error handling: Degradation if unstable. Example 2: Protein degradation Recognition: Exposed hydrophobic patches. Confirmation: Chaperones attempt refolding. Execution: Ubiquitination, degradation.

Recognition — Who Talks to Whom? Human Protocol:\nInternet protocols (e.g., TCP/IP) require devices to recognize IP addresses and ports. Handshake begins only if both addresses are correct, preventing random connections. Biological Protocol (Plant Example):\nFLS2 receptor on plant cells recognizes flagellin (flg22) from bacteria — PAMP as \u0026ldquo;packet header\u0026rdquo;. Co-receptor BAK1 joins only if FLS2 is bound to valid flagellin — like verifying sender\u0026rsquo;s address. Incorrect PAMP or mutations prevent handshake — signal aborted. Explicit Protocol Steps:\nStep Human Network Protocol Plant Immune Protocol Identification IP address lookup FLS2 recognizes flg22 First handshake SYN request FLS2-ligand binding Confirmation SYN-ACK BAK1 joins FLS2 2. Negotiation — Ensuring Context and Compatibility Human Protocol:\nDevices negotiate encryption (e.g., TLS), packet size, authentication. Connection happens only if negotiation is successful. Biological Protocol (Plant Example):\nBAK1 binding requires FLS2 to be correctly folded and positioned on the membrane. Membrane environment (lipid rafts) and post-translational modifications (PTMs) influence ability to negotiate. If FLS2 is misfolded or lacks phosphorylation, BAK1 will NOT engage — negotiation failed. Explicit Protocol Elements:\nParameter Human Protocol Plant Immune Example Packet format TLS version, cipher suite PTM (phosphorylation) state Connection mode Persistent/temporary FLS2 membrane localization Environment check Network congestion Membrane composition (rafts) 3. Execution — Transfer of Information / Activation Human Protocol:\nAfter negotiation, data transmission begins — reliable, structured. Biological Protocol (Plant Example):\nOnce FLS2-BAK1 complex forms, phosphorylation cascade (BIK1, MAPKs) is initiated. Leads to transcription of immune genes, callose deposition, defense metabolites. Clear, structured output — just like confirmed data transmission. 4. Error Handling — Preventing False Activation and Managing Failures Human Protocol:\nIf packet corrupted or spoofed → rejected. TCP resets connection on failed handshake. Biological Protocol (Plant Example):\nNegative regulators (e.g., BIR proteins) prevent BAK1-FLS2 complex formation when no real PAMP is present — a \u0026ldquo;firewall\u0026rdquo; against false positives. Chaperones ensure FLS2 folding; misfolded proteins are degraded — protocol self-repair. If pathogen effectors (e.g., AvrPtoB) block FLS2, NLR receptors can detect and trigger ETI (Effector-Triggered Immunity) — fallback defense. Explicit Handling:\nFailure Type Human Protocol Handling Plant Protocol Handling Spoofed packet Packet rejected PAMP mimic rejected Handshake failure TCP reset No BAK1 engagement Attack detected Security escalation NLR activation (ETI) 5. Memory — Remembering Past Interactions Human Protocol:\nPersistent sessions, cookies, authentication tokens for future connections. Biological Protocol (Plant Example):\nPTM marks (e.g., SUMOylation, phosphorylation) persist on signaling components for faster response. Chromatin modifications (e.g., histone methylation/acetylation) as long-term immune memory, priming for future pathogen attack. 6. Protocol Failure and Disease — What Happens When Protocols Break? Aspect Human Protocol Failure Example Plant Protocol Failure Example Handshake blocked Connection timeout Pathogen effectors block FLS2-BAK1 Overactive response DoS attack Autoimmunity, growth inhibition (JA/SA conflict) Failed detection Security hole Mutant PRRs fail to recognize PAMPs Key Differences \u0026amp; Similarities: Human vs. Biological Protocols Aspect Human Protocol Biological Protocol (Plant) Design Origin Engineered, designed Evolved, historical Negotiation Explicit (version, encryption) Implicit (PTMs, conformation, co-receptors) Layering OSI/TCP-IP layers Molecular, Cellular, Systemic Error handling Packet rejection, reset Negative regulators, NLR backups Security Authentication, encryption Pathogen detection, multi-layered defense Memory/Adaptation Session persistence, tokens Epigenetic marks, PTM priming Failure consequences Data breach, system crash Infection, autoimmunity, growth defects Conclusion — Why Protocol Thinking Matters for Biology Biological systems, like human-engineered systems, rely on rules of negotiation, recognition, and controlled communication.\nThinking in protocols clarifies why interactions happen, why others fail, and how organisms manage complexity.\nPlant systems offer some of the clearest biological protocol examples — layered, negotiated, dynamically adapted.\nViewing biology as a world of protocols allows us to understand disease as protocol failure, and immunity as adaptive protocol management.\nLife does not run on chaos — it runs on protocols.\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/en/posts/mind/sparks/s3_1/","summary":"Like us, life negotiates. Systems within systems.","title":"Life Runs on Protocols"},{"content":"Protocol Layers in Biology — From Molecules to Systems Introduction Biological communication is not a chaotic mess of molecules; it follows layered protocols, much like human network protocols.\nThese layers organize communication and decision-making from molecular interactions to whole-organism responses.\nHere, we explore four main protocol layers in biology, using plants as a model system:\nMolecular Layer — Protocols that Govern Molecular Interactions Cellular Layer — Protocols for Intercellular Communication Network Layer — Protocols that Coordinate Conflicting Signals System Layer — Protocols for Organism-Wide Coordination Biological communication is not a chaotic mess of molecules; it follows layered protocols, much like human network protocols.\nThese layers organize communication and decision-making from molecular interactions to whole-organism responses.\nExplore each layer to see how life negotiates complexity.\n1. Molecular Layer — Local Interactions and Direct Negotiation The molecular layer handles direct molecular communication — protein-protein interactions, ligand-receptor binding, scaffold complex assembly.\nThese are the basic negotiation units of biological systems.\nExample: MAPK Cascade in Plants Scaffold proteins (like RACK1) assemble kinases (MAPKKKs, MAPKKs, MAPKs) into signaling complexes. Interaction depends on domains (e.g., SH2, WD40) and PTMs (e.g., phosphorylation). Protocol flow: Recognition: Kinases bind scaffold — domain compatibility. Negotiation: Activation via phosphorylation — modification state matters. Execution: Signal relayed downstream via activated MAPK. Error Handling: Phosphatases remove signals; chaperones assist folding. Failure Example: Mutated MAPK domains → fail to bind scaffold — protocol collapse, no signaling. Improper PTMs → miscommunication, wrong pathways activated. 2. Cellular Layer — Receptors, Co-receptors, and Complex Formation The cellular layer manages how cells interpret external signals, primarily via receptor-ligand systems.\nExample: PRR (Pattern Recognition Receptor) Systems in Plant Immunity FLS2 receptor binds bacterial flagellin (flg22), triggering immune signaling. BAK1 co-receptor joins only upon proper ligand binding — two-step handshake. Protocol flow: Recognition: FLS2 detects flg22. Negotiation: BAK1 recruited if FLS2 is correctly bound. Execution: Phosphorylation cascades (BIK1, MAPKs). Error Handling: BIR proteins prevent false activation. Failure Example: Effectors like AvrPto block FLS2 — failed handshake, immune evasion. FLS2 misfolding — no BAK1 engagement, signaling aborted. 3. Network Layer — Multi-Pathway Coordination and Signal Integration The network layer coordinates multiple signals within a cell, integrating conflicting or cooperative signals to decide response priorities.\nExample: JA-SA Crosstalk in Defense and Growth JA (Jasmonic Acid) and SA (Salicylic Acid) regulate defense, but often mutually antagonistic. Cells use priority signaling depending on threat type (e.g., SA for biotrophs, JA for necrotrophs). Protocol Logic: Recognition: Detect pathogen type via PRRs. Negotiation: Balance JA/SA based on context. Execution: Select appropriate downstream pathways (defense gene activation). Error Handling: Negative regulators (e.g., NPR1 for SA) suppress alternative pathway. Failure Example: Failed prioritization: Overactive JA suppresses SA → biotroph infection. Autoimmunity: Misregulated JA-SA balance → growth inhibition. 4. System Layer — Long-Distance Communication and Systemic Coordination The system layer manages whole-organism responses, transmitting signals across tissues for coordinated action.\nExample: Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) After local pathogen detection, systemic signals (e.g., methyl salicylate) prime distant tissues for defense. Layers involve hormone transport, vascular signaling, and chromatin priming. Protocol Flow: Recognition: Local PRR activation. Negotiation: Signal amplification via SA. Execution: Systemic signal dispatch (MeSA), distal tissue priming. Memory: Epigenetic marks on defense genes for faster future responses. Failure Example: Disrupted signal transport: SAR fails, systemic tissues vulnerable. Impaired chromatin response: No long-term immune memory. Why Protocol Layers Matter Thinking of biology as layered protocols helps explain:\nHow signals are selected, processed, and executed. Why certain signals fail to propagate or are suppressed. How complexity is managed from molecules to whole organisms. Protocols organize life — making sense of molecular chaos through structured, layered negotiation.\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/en/posts/mind/sparks/s3_2/","summary":"Life is not chaos — it runs on layered, negotiated protocols, from molecules to whole organisms.","title":"Protocol Layers in Biology — From Molecules to Systems"},{"content":"The Molecular Layer — How Proteins Negotiate At the molecular level, proteins, RNAs, and small molecules constantly meet each other inside cells. But not every meeting leads to interaction. Instead, molecules engage only under strict rules — what we can think of as molecular protocols. These are rules encoded in domain structures, post-translational modifications (PTMs), folding status, and even the surrounding environment.\nThese protocols govern who talks to whom, under what conditions, and what happens next.\nExample 1: MAPK Cascade — Protocol Managed by Scaffold Proteins The MAPK cascade is a conserved signaling pathway in both plants and animals. It involves three kinases (MAPKKK → MAPKK → MAPK) that must activate each other in a precise order to transmit a signal.\nBut these kinases don’t just \u0026ldquo;find each other\u0026rdquo; randomly in the crowded cytoplasm. Instead, scaffold proteins — like KSR in mammals or RACK1 in plants — act as protocol managers, assembling the kinases in the right order and preventing false signaling.\nProtocol breakdown (step-by-step): Step Action Recognition Scaffold protein binds specific docking sites on each kinase — handshake. Negotiation Each kinase’s PTMs and proper folding are checked — header verification. Execution Scaffold brings kinases together for phosphorylation — data exchange. Confirmation Scaffold holds the complex until signaling completes — session state. Error handling Misfolded or incorrect kinases are rejected — negotiation failed. Network analogy: Like a TCP/IP handshake, making sure both parties are ready before exchanging data.\nFailure Example:\nIf MAPKs are mutated or scaffold proteins are missing, the protocol collapses — no signaling. In cancer, mutated RAS proteins can bypass scaffolds, activating MAPK without negotiation — leading to uncontrolled proliferation. Example 2: SH2 Domains and Phosphotyrosine Binding — Shape and Modification as Header SH2 domains recognize phosphotyrosine residues, but not all phosphotyrosines are accepted.\nSH2 domains bind only when the phosphotyrosine is correctly presented in a structural loop, with neighboring residues matching the SH2 binding pocket. Thus, 3D folding + PTM together form the molecular header that makes interaction possible. Without the right shape, even a phosphorylated site will be ignored — the handshake fails. Failure Mode Example:\nIn cancer, RAS mutations (e.g., G12V, Q61L) break protocol — forcing MAPK cascade activation without scaffold mediation, bypassing safety checks. Interpretation: A failed negotiation protocol — like a rogue client sending unauthorized data, crashing the system. Summary of Molecular Protocol Logic Protocol Step Biological Example Network Analogy Recognition Scaffold binds MAPKs; SH2 binds phosphotyrosine Initial packet recognition Negotiation PTMs checked, protein folding verified Packet header check Execution Kinase cascade proceeds Data transmission Confirmation Scaffold stabilizes complex during signaling Session management Error handling Misfolded proteins rejected, degraded Packet rejection, connection reset Failure example RAS/MAPK pathway hyperactivated in cancer Protocol bypass causing system crash Key Takeaways for the Molecular Layer Protein-protein interactions are not random — they are negotiated through domain structures, PTMs, and folding states. Molecules act only when all “headers” are correct — deciding who talks to whom is tightly controlled. Scaffold proteins serve as protocol managers, assembling signaling complexes with precision and error control. Protocol failures — like scaffold loss or forced activation — are at the root of diseases such as cancer. Thinking in protocols explains why some interactions never happen, and why others (when forced) can be disastrous. \u0026ldquo;Life at the molecular level is not chaos — it\u0026rsquo;s a system of structured negotiations.\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/posts/mind/sparks/S3_21/","summary":"Protein interactions aren\u0026rsquo;t random — they follow strict molecular protocols.","title":"Molecular Layer — How Proteins Negotiate"},{"content":"Cellular Layer — How Cells Negotiate and Confirm Signals Cells constantly exchange information, but communication is not automatic.\nInstead, multi-step cellular protocols govern who gets heard, when, and how — involving receptors, co-receptors, and environment-dependent modifications.\nExample 1: Plant PRR-BAK1 Complex — A Structured Handshake for Immunity In plant innate immunity, Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) detect PAMPs (Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns) like bacterial flagellin.\nBut recognition alone is not enough — co-receptor BAK1 must join for the signal to proceed, forming a multi-step handshake.\nProtocol Breakdown (step-by-step): Step Action Recognition FLS2 binds flg22 (PAMP) — packet reception. Negotiation BAK1 joins only if FLS2-flg22 complex is formed — handshake validation. Execution Kinase cascade (BIK1, MAPKs) propagates the immune signal. Confirmation Scaffold proteins stabilize the receptor complex. Error handling BIR proteins prevent false activations. Failure Example:\nPathogen effectors (e.g., AvrPto) block BAK1 recruitment — handshake hijacked, immune response blocked. Example 2: Mammalian Immune Synapse — Stepwise Confirmation to Prevent Error T cell activation requires multiple confirmations — a complex negotiated immune protocol.\nRecognition: TCR binds antigen on MHC. Negotiation: Co-receptors (CD4 or CD8) confirm MHC type. Co-stimulation: CD28 binds B7 — essential handshake. Execution: Intracellular signaling (ZAP70, LAT). Error handling: CTLA-4 can terminate the process if activation is inappropriate. Failure Example:\nIf checkpoints (like CTLA-4) fail, autoimmune diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis can arise — protocol breakdown. Key Takeaways for Cellular Layer Cell-cell communication is a negotiated, multi-step protocol, not a simple binding event. Co-receptors and scaffolds act as protocol managers, confirming and stabilizing interactions. Error handling mechanisms prevent false signaling — when these fail, disease follows.

Salicylic Acid (SA) fights biotrophic pathogens. Activating both pathways together would waste energy and create conflicts — hence priority negotiation is required.\nProtocol Breakdown (Conflict Resolution): Step Action Recognition PAMPs trigger both JA and SA pathways. Negotiation NPR1 evaluates context, prioritizing SA or JA. Execution Defense genes activated based on chosen pathway. Feedback SA upregulates NPR1 — reinforcing the decision.

Data Structures in Biology — How Life Organizes Information Biological Data Structure Computational Analog Example in Plants Purpose Linear chain Array, List DNA, RNA, protein primary structure Store sequence information Nested modules/domains Objects, Nested structures Protein domains (e.g., SH2, LRR) Modular functional components Tree-like structure Tree, Trie Signal transduction pathways, cell lineage differentiation Hierarchical decision-making Graph/network Graph Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks Dynamic interaction networks Hash table Hash Map Membrane nanodomains concentrating receptors/kinases Fast spatial access Priority queue Priority Queue, Heap JA vs SA signal prioritization Dynamic prioritization of responses Cache/memory table Cache, Lookup Table Immune memory, chromatin openness Quick recall of past information Bloom filter (probabilistic filter) Bloom Filter Rapid non-specific pathogen detection Fast approximate filtering Circular/doubly linked list Circular/Doubly Linked List Circadian rhythms, cell cycle Cyclical biological processes Matrix/tensor Matrix, Tensor Gene regulation matrices (TF-target relationships) Multi-dimensional regulatory control Sparse matrix Sparse Matrix Conditional or rare interactions Resource-efficient encoding Queue/buffer Queue, Buffer Protein trafficking (ER to Golgi) Ordered processing flow 2. Biological Algorithms — How Life Computes Responses 2.1 Conditional Algorithms — If-Else Logic in Signaling Example: JA-SA cross-talk for immune defense versus growth. Logic: \u0026ldquo;If pathogen present, activate defense; else, maintain growth.\u0026rdquo; Algorithm type: Branching logic for response prioritization. 2.2 Learning Algorithms — Adaptive Memory Formation Example: Epigenetic marks following pathogen exposure (e.g., SAR in plants). System learns and recalls pathogen patterns. Analogous to: Reinforcement learning — optimizing response based on past outcomes. 2.3 Optimization Algorithms — Resource Allocation Example: DELLA-mediated regulation to balance growth and defense. Challenge: Trade-off between survival and reproduction. Algorithm type: Multi-objective optimization, dynamic decision-making. 3. Interplay of Data Structures, Algorithms, and Protocols Layer Role in Biology Example Data Structures Organize and store biological information Chromatin domains, protein complexes Algorithms Compute decisions and adaptations Immune activation, JA-SA prioritization Protocols Manage communication and coordination PRR-BAK1 signaling, hormone pathways 4.

Potential attackers (hackers vs. pathogens). The need for dynamic yet precise communication. Here, we explore deep parallels between TCP/IP and biological signaling, focusing on handshake logic, layering, and architecture — showing how life runs on negotiated, structured systems.\nTCP/IP Handshake — A Model of Structured Negotiation Computer networks use three-way handshakes to establish reliable communication:\nSYN (synchronize): Client requests connection. SYN-ACK (acknowledge): Server responds, confirming. ACK: Client confirms; connection established. Key features:\nSequential, layered confirmation. Negotiation and acknowledgment. Abortion if checks fail — no connection. Biological Handshake — Receptor-Ligand-Co-receptor Systems Cells do not respond to random molecules. They require multi-step confirmation, much like TCP handshakes.\nExample: Plant FLS2-BAK1 Immune Receptor Complex Step Biological Action TCP Analogy Recognition FLS2 binds flagellin (PAMP). SYN — connection request. Co-receptor Join BAK1 joins if flagellin is correct. SYN-ACK — acknowledgment. Activation FLS2-BAK1 triggers kinase cascades. ACK — confirmed handshake. Fail-safes: Without BAK1, no signal — preventing false alarms.\nLike TCP, biological handshakes avoid false positives.\nLayers of Protocols — OSI Model vs. Biological Systems Both systems are layered architectures, where higher functions depend on lower confirmations.\nOSI Layer Network Role Biological Parallel Physical Bit transmission over cables. Molecular binding — receptor-ligand contact. Data Link MAC, node recognition. Shape, charge, domain-specific binding. Network Routing (IP). Membrane localization, scaffold assembly. Transport Reliable delivery (TCP). Receptor-co-receptor handshake, signal confirmation. Session Manage ongoing exchange. Scaffold-stabilized complexes during signaling.

Architecture — Why Protocols Need Structure Just as TCP/IP runs on hardware architecture (routers, nodes, layers), biological protocols run on molecular architectures:\nMembrane domains (lipid rafts) as routing platforms. Scaffold proteins as structural platforms assembling components. Dynamic localization of molecules — akin to routing tables for packet delivery. Compartmentalization (organelles) like subnetworks limiting protocol range. No protocol runs in a vacuum — it runs on a carefully built architecture.\nSecurity Protocols — Preventing Hijacking Network protocols use encryption and authentication.\nBiological systems use multi-step checks:\nNegative regulators (BIR proteins) prevent accidental activation. Chaperones ensure correct folding before receptor use. NLR proteins detect if a pathogen tries to hijack the handshake — like intrusion detection systems (IDS). Failure Examples: Failure Scenario Network Analogy Biological Example Man-in-the-middle attack Attacker fakes handshake. Pathogen effector blocks FLS2-BAK1 handshake. Spoofed packet Fake IP packet sent. Mutated PAMP misleads receptor, blocked downstream. Error Handling and Abort Mechanisms TCP resets failed connections. Cells abort faulty handshakes:\nFailed co-receptor binding ⟶ No downstream activation. Wrong PTMs ⟶ Interaction blocked. Scaffold disassembly ⟶ Complex falls apart if unstable. Better no connection than false activation.\nPersistent Sessions — Memory and Reuse TCP allows persistent sessions. Cells remember:\nImmune memory — faster response to known pathogens. Primed receptors — ready for quick action. Epigenetic marks — system-wide priming of future responses.

Architecture Hardware, routers, routing tables. Membranes, scaffolds, compartmentalization. Security checks Authentication, encryption. Co-receptors, PTMs, negative regulators. Error handling Packet rejection, connection reset. Abort signaling if improper. Memory Persistent sessions, caching. Immune memory, epigenetic marks. Final Thoughts — Why This Matters Biological signaling is not chaos — it is protocol and architecture working together.\nUnderstanding life this way explains diseases as protocol failures, and opens paths for:\nDrug design targeting broken handshakes. Synthetic biology circuits based on layered protocols. Bio-inspired computing using protocol negotiation logic. Life runs on negotiated architectures — structured, verified, and remembered.\nFuture Directions — What We Can Learn Can AI systems adopt biologically inspired protocols to become more robust?

From protein complexes to signaling pathways, biological systems assemble molecules and signals using patterns that closely resemble classical data structures like trees, graphs, queues, and stacks.\nJust as software systems rely on data structures to organize complexity, biological systems use molecular architectures to control interaction, flow, and decision-making.\nIn this article, we explore how data structures shape biological behavior, and why thinking this way gives us new tools to understand life.\nLife runs on structured data — folded, assembled, and connected.\n1. Trees — Hierarchical Information and Signaling Cascades Tree Structures in Computer Science Trees organize data hierarchically: parent nodes, child nodes. Example: File systems, XML/JSON documents, decision trees. Biological Parallel — Signaling Cascades MAPK cascade: sequential kinase activations (MAPKKK → MAPKK → MAPK). Hormone signaling (e.g., auxin pathway): hierarchical activation of receptors, co-repressors, transcription factors. Why Tree Logic? Hierarchical control: upstream decisions influence downstream actions. Error handling: if a step fails, the cascade aborts — like pruning branches. Signal amplification: one receptor activating many downstream components — like branching nodes. Key Example: MAPK cascade as a depth-first traversal through signaling layers.\n2. Graphs — Networks of Interactions and Crosstalk Graphs in Computer Science Graphs represent nodes (entities) and edges (connections). Example: Social networks, internet architecture, dependency graphs. Biological Parallel — Interaction Networks Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Metabolic pathways and gene regulatory networks. Signaling crosstalk: e.g., JA/SA pathways influencing each other. Graph Properties in Biology Small-world: Highly connected hubs (e.g., scaffold proteins like RACK1). Scale-free: A few nodes dominate connectivity — critical regulators. Dynamic edges: Interactions form and dissolve based on cellular context (PTMs, localization). Key Example: Scaffold proteins as hubs controlling flow in biological graphs.\n3. Queues and Stacks — Ordered Processing and Priority Control Queues \u0026amp; Stacks in Computer Science Queue: First-in, first-out (FIFO). Stack: Last-in, first-out (LIFO). Manage ordered tasks, function calls, event handling. Biological Parallel — Sequential and Priority-Based Processes Protein folding and degradation queues: Chaperones and proteasomes handle substrates in order. Signaling priority: Cells prioritize urgent signals over background noise (e.g., immune over growth). Vesicle transport: Proteins loaded and released in sequence — like a queue. Priority Control Examples Stress responses overriding growth — dynamic reordering. Delayed responses (e.g., immune memory): a form of stack — latest activation remembered. Key Example: Unfolded protein response (UPR) as a managed queue for protein processing.\n4. Dynamic Data Structures — Flexible, Context-Dependent Assembly Unlike rigid software data structures, biological structures are dynamic:\nProtein complexes assemble/disassemble based on PTMs, ligand binding. Signaling hubs adapt composition depending on input (e.g., different scaffold complexes for same kinase). Phase separation: dynamic condensates as \u0026quot;soft\u0026quot; data structures that form on-demand (e.g., stress granules). Key Example: RACK1 forming different complexes depending on stress vs. growth context — dynamic graph hubs.\nWhy Thinking in Data Structures Helps Clarifies architecture: See biological interactions as organized, not chaotic. Explains specificity: Why do only some molecules interact? Because the structure allows it — like connections in a graph. Reveals vulnerabilities: When data structures collapse (e.g., hub mutations), the system fails — like breaking critical graph nodes. Informs bioengineering: Designing synthetic pathways using modular data structure logic. Life runs on structured data — folded, assembled, and connected. Thinking in data structures is key to decoding biological complexity.\nFuture Questions Can we model dynamic biological assemblies as evolving graphs?

Instead, they represent highly organized networks of interactions, governed by specific molecular rules, spatial constraints, and dynamic regulations.\nInterestingly, many of these biological organizations bear striking conceptual resemblance to classical data structures used in computer science — such as trees, graphs, queues, and dynamic assemblies. While biological systems are not software, and these metaphors cannot fully capture biological complexity, thinking in terms of data structures provides a useful framework to conceptualize and analyze biological organization.\nIn this article, we explore how analogies to data structures can illuminate biological mechanisms, highlighting both the value and limits of this perspective.\n1. Trees — Hierarchical Organization and Signal Cascades 1.1 Tree Structures in Computer Science (Concept) In computer science, trees are hierarchical data structures with parent and child nodes. Trees are used to organize data and define sequential decision-making processes. Examples include file systems, XML/JSON documents, and decision trees.\n1.2 Biological Parallels: Signaling Cascades as Hierarchies Many biological signaling processes are inherently hierarchical, resembling tree-like structures:\nMAPK cascades involve sequential activation of kinases (e.g., MAPKKK → MAPKK → MAPK), where upstream activations control downstream responses. Hormone signaling pathways (e.g., auxin, cytokinin pathways) often follow hierarchical activation of receptors, repressors, and transcription factors. 1.3 Functional Implications Hierarchical control ensures that upstream signals regulate downstream outcomes. Error handling is built-in: failed upstream activation aborts downstream events — akin to pruning tree branches. Signal amplification can occur through branching, where one activated node influences many downstream targets. Key Example: The MAPK cascade functions like a depth-first traversal of signaling layers, ensuring precise propagation of cellular signals.\n2. Graphs — Networks of Interactions and Signaling Crosstalk 2.1 Graph Structures in Computer Science (Concept) Graphs consist of nodes (entities) and edges (connections), and are used to model complex networks such as social networks, the internet, and dependency graphs.\n2.2 Biological Parallels: Interaction Networks Biological systems are fundamentally networked:\nProtein-protein interaction (PPI) networks map the physical and functional interactions between proteins. Gene regulatory networks describe transcription factors regulating multiple target genes. Metabolic pathways can be modeled as graphs of enzymatic reactions. Signaling crosstalk (e.g., between JA/SA pathways) reflects overlapping and interdependent pathways. 2.3 Properties of Biological Graphs Small-world networks: highly connected hubs (e.g., scaffold proteins like RACK1) enable efficient communication. Scale-free topology: a few highly connected nodes (hubs) dominate, reflecting key regulators. Dynamic edges: interactions are context-dependent — modified by PTMs, localization, or external signals. Key Example: Scaffold proteins (e.g., RACK1) act as hubs, dynamically assembling different complexes depending on cellular context, shaping the overall network topology.\n3. Ordered Processing — Sequential Logic, Queues, and Priority Handling 3.1 Concept of Queues and Stacks in Computer Science (Analogy) Queue: First-in, first-out (FIFO), managing tasks in sequential order. Stack: Last-in, first-out (LIFO), managing tasks by most recent priority (e.g., function calls). 3.2 Biological Analogies: Ordered and Prioritized Processing (Caution: Metaphor) Though biological processes are not strict queues or stacks, certain systems exhibit ordered and prioritized processing behaviors:\nProtein folding and degradation: Chaperones and proteasomes handle misfolded proteins sequentially. Vesicle transport: Sequential loading and release of cargo proteins in trafficking pathways. Signaling priority: Cells prioritize urgent responses (e.g., immune signaling suppressing growth pathways under stress). 3.3 Examples of Biological \u0026ldquo;Queue-like\u0026rdquo; Systems Unfolded Protein Response (UPR): A regulated system managing the burden of misfolded proteins, acting like a controlled queue of substrates. Stress vs. growth responses: Cells dynamically prioritize stress responses over growth, resembling \u0026ldquo;priority handling\u0026rdquo;. ⚠️ Note: These analogies help conceptualize order and priority but should not be confused with strict computational implementations.\n4. Dynamic Data Structures — Flexible, Context-Dependent Assemblies 4.1 Dynamic Structures in Biology (Experimental Evidence) Unlike static data structures, biological assemblies are highly dynamic:\nProtein complexes: Assemble/disassemble based on post-translational modifications (PTMs), ligand binding, and environmental cues. Phase-separated condensates: Membraneless organelles (e.g., stress granules, P bodies) form via liquid-liquid phase separation — dynamic, reversible assemblies that respond to cellular conditions. Scaffold-dependent complexes: Scaffold proteins like RACK1 form different interaction hubs under stress vs. normal growth. 4.2 Functional Insights from Dynamic Structures Flexibility and responsiveness: Dynamic assemblies allow rapid adaptation to changing environments. Regulatory control: Conditional formation ensures that interactions occur only when appropriate. Key Example: RACK1 as a scaffold that assembles distinct complexes under stress versus growth conditions — a dynamic \u0026ldquo;hub\u0026rdquo; adapting biological graphs.\n5. Why Data Structure Thinking Matters Clarifies biological architecture: Conceptualizing biological systems as structured rather than chaotic. Explains specificity: Why only certain molecules interact under defined contexts — permitted connections in a \u0026ldquo;graph\u0026rdquo;. Reveals vulnerabilities: Mutations in hubs (key nodes) can collapse entire interaction networks — graph collapse as a model for disease. Informs synthetic biology: Applying modular design principles akin to data structure logic to engineer synthetic biological circuits. 6. Future Directions and Open Questions Dynamic graphs: How can we model evolving biological interaction networks under different conditions? Priority systems: Can queue/stack-like principles help predict which signals dominate in complex signaling environments? Phase-separated compartments: How can we analyze these dynamic, context-dependent assemblies as functional biological \u0026ldquo;data containers\u0026rdquo;? Conclusion Viewing biological systems through the lens of data structures offers a powerful, though metaphorical, framework to understand complexity, modularity, and dynamic regulation in life. While biological molecules do not follow computational rules literally, these analogies highlight the structured logic underlying biological function — from protein networks to signaling pathways.\n\u0026ldquo;Life runs on structured data — folded, assembled, and connected.\u0026rdquo;\nPart of the Protocol Biology series — where biology meets computation as evolving, living algorithms.\nSuggested References Barabási, A.-L., \u0026amp; Oltvai, Z.

Traditionally, life is defined by characteristics such as metabolism, reproduction, evolution, and response to stimuli. But as molecular and systems biology have advanced, it has become clear that life operates not merely through chemical reactions, but through structured, regulated interactions.\nIn this essay, I explore the idea that life can be viewed as a system of biological \u0026ldquo;protocols\u0026rdquo; — defined, rule-governed interactions that resemble communication protocols in information science. By re-examining life through this lens, we may find new ways to integrate molecular biology, systems thinking, and philosophical inquiry.\n1. Biological Protocols: Structured Interactions in Life 1.1 Molecular Interactions as Protocols At the molecular level, biological processes rely on highly specific recognition and interaction mechanisms:\nProtein-protein interactions depend on domain matching, structural compatibility, and post-translational modifications (PTMs), akin to a \u0026ldquo;handshake protocol\u0026rdquo; in communication. Protein-DNA interactions follow sequence-specific recognition patterns. Enzyme-substrate interactions are regulated through active site specificity and allosteric control. These interactions are not random; they are condition-dependent, context-sensitive, and often layered, requiring multiple levels of verification before an action proceeds — much like multi-step authentication in digital systems.\n1.2 Cellular and Systemic Protocols At higher levels of biological organization:\nSignal transduction pathways involve multiple checkpoints and feedback mechanisms to ensure fidelity. Immune recognition employs multi-layer verification to distinguish self from non-self, avoiding inappropriate activation. Neuronal communication via synapses depends on neurotransmitter release, receptor binding, and co-factors — a cascade of conditional steps. These layered interactions form what can be interpreted as biological protocols — structured \u0026ldquo;rules\u0026rdquo; that govern cellular and systemic behaviors.\n2. Origin of Life: The Emergence of Molecular Protocols 2.1 The RNA World as the First Protocol System One plausible hypothesis for the origin of life is the RNA World, where RNA molecules served both as information carriers and catalysts. This dual role enabled early forms of molecular interaction governed by sequence and structure:\nBase-pair complementarity: Early recognition protocols. Catalysis dependent on proper folding: Early error-checking mechanisms. Selective replication: Only sequences following specific \u0026ldquo;interaction rules\u0026rdquo; would persist — an early form of evolutionary protocol optimization. 2.2 From Chaos to Order: The Philosophical Angle From a philosophical perspective, the emergence of life can be seen as the emergence of ordered interaction from chaos. The first \u0026ldquo;protocol\u0026rdquo; was perhaps the first instance when molecules recognized and responded to each other according to shared structural logic — the beginning of biological order.\n3. Protocols and the Mind: Toward an Understanding of Consciousness 3.1 Neural Interactions as Protocols The nervous system operates through highly regulated synaptic communication:\nSynaptic firing occurs only under tightly regulated molecular conditions. Neural networks form and strengthen connections through repeated successful interactions, consistent with Hebbian principles (\u0026ldquo;what fires together, wires together\u0026rdquo;). Thus, cognition and perception may be viewed as emergent properties of dynamic molecular and cellular protocols — recursive networks of interactions governed by biochemical rules.\n3.2 Higher-Order Protocols: Language, Self, and Decision Language relies on shared social \u0026ldquo;protocols\u0026rdquo; for meaning-making. Self-awareness may emerge from internal feedback loops — the brain negotiating internal states. Decision-making involves competitive and cooperative neural interactions, dynamically regulated to produce coherent action. While \u0026ldquo;protocol\u0026rdquo; remains a metaphor here, it captures the systemic and recursive nature of cognitive processes.\n4. Death as the Collapse of Biological Protocols 4.1 Cellular Breakdown At the cellular level, death can be understood as the failure of fundamental interaction rules:\nProtein misfolding and loss of chaperone function. Cessation of DNA repair and accumulation of mutations. Signal transduction failure and the collapse of communication networks. 4.2 Systemic Breakdown Immune system collapse, leading to self/non-self discrimination failures. Neural degeneration, where synaptic communication disintegrates, as seen in neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, death may be conceptualized as the progressive breakdown of biological \u0026ldquo;protocols\u0026rdquo; that sustain life — a loss of communication fidelity.\n5. From Physics to Life: Is Existence Structured by Protocols? 5.1 Physical Interactions as Proto-Protocols At the most fundamental level:\nParticles interact according to physical laws (quantum mechanics, electromagnetism) — immutable \u0026ldquo;protocols\u0026rdquo; of nature. Chemical bonds form when atomic orbitals align under specific energetic and spatial conditions — interaction rules. Molecular assemblies arise when non-covalent interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions) follow compatible geometries. 5.2 Scaling Up: Complexity as Layers of Protocol From particles to life: Particles (Physical Laws) → Atoms (Orbital Rules) → Molecules (Chemical Specificity) → Cells (Biological Protocols) → Minds (Cognitive Negotiations). Thus, life may represent a high-order manifestation of the universe\u0026rsquo;s intrinsic interaction rules — a layered hierarchy of protocols.\nConclusion To summarize:\nLife operates through structured, conditional interactions, analogous to communication protocols. The origin of life may be seen as the emergence of the first molecular \u0026ldquo;negotiation rules.\u0026rdquo; Cognition and consciousness may arise from recursive biological protocols at cellular and systemic levels. Death is the systematic failure of these interactions. Existence itself — from physics to biology — may be underpinned by interaction rules, which we might conceptualize as \u0026ldquo;protocols.\u0026rdquo; While \u0026ldquo;protocol\u0026rdquo; is a metaphor, it captures the regulated, structured, and contingent nature of biological and physical interactions. Thinking in terms of protocols may help bridge disciplines — from molecular biology to philosophy — offering a unified way to think about complexity, emergence, and the nature of existence.\n\u0026ldquo;Do not think about meaning — to exist is duty.\u0026rdquo; — Goethe\nReferences (Suggested for Expansion) Koonin, E.

Ligand-independent activation requires high surface densities, while EGF binding enables activation at lower densities. Activation relies on N-terminal TM helix dimerization, coupled with antiparallel JM-A interactions, to stabilize the active asymmetric kinase dimer. Intracellular module (ICM) tethering to the membrane inhibits activation, highlighting the role of membrane-imposed constraints.\nNotes 1. Ligand-Independent Activation Depends on EGFR Surface Density Without EGF, EGFR autophosphorylation increases with receptor surface density, reaching near-ligand-induced levels only at very high densities. With EGF, phosphorylation occurs efficiently even at low receptor densities. A beautiful demonstration that ligand binding bypasses the need for high receptor density, stabilizing key dimer interfaces. 2. Extracellular Module Blocks Activation Without Ligand TM-ICM (lacking extracellular module) is constitutively active at the plasma membrane, even at low densities. Inserting a flexible linker between extracellular module and TM (ECM-GlySer-TM-ICM) allows ligand-independent activation, suggesting that the extracellular domain restrains the TM and ICM in the inactive state. EGFR\u0026rsquo;s extracellular domain functions as a \u0026ldquo;clamp\u0026rdquo; — preventing spontaneous activation. 3. Intracellular Module Is Inhibited at Plasma Membrane Without TM Helix Membrane-tethered Myr-ICM (ICM alone) shows low phosphorylation, indicating inhibition by membrane interaction. However, Myr-GCN4-ICM (enforced dimer) is active, implying that forced dimerization can overcome membrane-imposed inhibition. Adding a flexible linker to ECM-TM-ICM (ECM-TM-GlySer-ICM) keeps it inhibited, even in presence of EGF — emphasizing the need for proper TM and JM coupling for activation. 4. EGFR ICM Is Predominantly Monomeric Without Ligand Two-color PIE-FCCS shows Myr-ICM is monomeric on membrane at various densities. Full-length EGFR is monomeric at low densities without EGF, but dimerizes upon EGF binding. Thus, EGFR requires ligand-induced extracellular rearrangement to promote TM and JM interactions necessary for kinase activation. 5. Structural Insights into TM and JM Segments via NMR NMR of TM-JM in lipid bilayer shows right-handed -44° crossing angle of TM helices, positioning C-terminal ends ~20 Å apart — enabling antiparallel JM-A dimerization. Intermolecular NOE confirms antiparallel JM-A interactions, involving conserved Leu-rich LRRLL motifs. 6. Disruption of TM N-terminal Interface Inhibits EGFR Activation I640E mutation (disrupts TM N-terminal interface) inhibits receptor activity. Disrupting N-terminal TM interface disrupts JM-A dimer formation, preventing kinase activation. Thus, N-terminal TM helix pairing is essential for EGFR activation — coupling extracellular events to intracellular kinase activation. Take-home Messages EGFR activation requires ligand-induced relief of extracellular constraints, allowing N-terminal TM dimerization and antiparallel JM-A interactions that stabilize the active kinase dimer. Without ligand, EGFR remains mostly monomeric and kinase domains are inhibited by the membrane. Artificial dimerization (e.g., GCN4 fusion) overcomes membrane inhibition, but correct TM-JM alignment is essential for physiological activation. This work highlights how transmembrane signaling requires precise conformational coupling across the membrane — from EGF binding to kinase activation. Final Thought: EGFR is not merely a dimerizing machine; it\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated allosteric switch controlled by a finely tuned, membrane-spanning conformational relay.\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/en/posts/mind/mindscape/76/","summary":"\u003cstrong\u003eAn elegant dissection\u003c/strong\u003e of how \u003cstrong\u003eEGFR activation\u003c/strong\u003e depends on \u003cstrong\u003econformational coupling across the plasma membrane\u003c/strong\u003e, revealing that \u003cstrong\u003eligand binding, transmembrane helix dimerization, and juxtamembrane interactions\u003c/strong\u003e are essential to overcoming \u003cstrong\u003emembrane-imposed inhibition\u003c/strong\u003e and stabilizing the active kinase dimer.","title":"Conformational Coupling Across the Plasma Membrane in Activation of the EGF Receptor"},{"content":"Book Recommendation: Dynamics in Enzyme Catalysis by Judith Klinman, Sharon Hammes-Schiffer\nFrom late 2024 to early 2025, I read Dynamics in Enzyme Catalysis, a book composed of 8 collected papers discussing the role of dynamics in enzyme mechanisms, co-edited by two leading figures in the field: Judith Klinman and Sharon Hammes-Schiffer.\nThis book provides deep insights into how protein motions and dynamics contribute to catalysis, especially from a theoretical and experimental perspective, including quantum mechanical tunneling, transition state theory, and protein motions.\nDownload Links Version with my annotations and reading notes:\nDownload here\nClean version without annotations:\n(Link to be added later)\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38962-7\nIf you are deeply interested in enzyme mechanisms, and especially in the role of protein dynamics and quantum chemistry in enzymology, this book is a unique and insightful resource.\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/en/posts/mind/mindscape/101/","summary":"An advanced collection of papers exploring the role of dynamics in enzyme catalysis, co-edited by Judith Klinman and Sharon Hammes-Schiffer.

Logically, it doesn’t make sense. But in trying to understand, I imagined spending a lifetime with him. Marriage, all of it.\nAnd in that moment of thinking, I was surprised to realize—I am an existentialist, maybe even an optimistic one.\nBecause of the distance.\nBecause of overthinking.\nBecause of arguments.\nBecause even after the arguments, he still stayed in my mind and heart.\nBecause he was in my mind and heart, I wanted to be certain.\nAnd the more I wanted to be certain, the more I marveled at the existence of this feeling.\nThere were times—during arguments—when I just wanted to be free.\nI told him again and again:\n“Then say it. Say you don’t love me. Say it so I can leave.”\nI was so ready to let go, if only he would give me that one clear answer.\nBut he wouldn’t.\nHe couldn’t.\nOn the phone, I imagined him sitting with his head in his hands, silent for a long time.\nAnd then, barely audible—almost like he was talking to himself:\n“No. I love.”\n“I love.”\nOver and over again, every time I asked.\nCalm. Certain. Like fact.\nAnd in those moments, I realized—love itself may not be entirely rational, but choosing to love, choosing how to love, is my freedom.\nI realized, I wholeheartedly agreed with Sartre and even came to like him.\n“The self is nothing more than the interpretation we give to the facts about us—and that interpretation is always changing.”\n— Jean-Paul Sartre, Being and Nothingness\nSartre criticized the idea that the self is simply something that exists. He called it self-deception—a refusal to take personal responsibility, an attempt to claim that life is dictated by factuality, using it as an excuse to escape the responsibility of who you are and who you will become.\n“We are our choices.”\n— Jean-Paul Sartre\nIt is the denial of your duty to create yourself, a surrender before even trying.\nBut the existentialist me wants to create the future me.\nAnd then, I started wondering—what if fate isn’t a straight line?\nWhat if fate is a circle? A loop?\nWhat if time is not pushing us forward, but folding back on itself—and in that spiral, we meet the same people again and again, and the choices we make begin to feel like destiny?\nZGY is not fate in the conventional sense. He was a coincidence—at first.\nBut I chose him.\nAnd maybe I’ve chosen him so many times—across so many loops—that now he feels inevitable.\nI murmured to myself:\n“Fate at first glance. Every glance after—still fate.”\nFrom nineteen to twenty-eight.\nI don’t know. Maybe I’ve always known.\nMaybe that’s the problem.\nSo no—he wasn’t fate when we met.\nBut he became my fate, because I keep choosing him.\nSo, love is my choice.\nAnd because it is a choice I keep making, again and again, it becomes my freedom.\nAnd it becomes my fate.\nMaybe fate is just a memory from the future.\nI don’t know, it’s kind of amazing.\nI have found—or perhaps created—a new version of myself.\nZGY was the catalyst.\nOr maybe evolution.\nOr maybe a message sent backward from the self I am becoming.\nOf course, my animal instincts.\nBut also my metaphysics.\nSo I love you.\nAmong so many people, I only want to hold you, kiss you, and form a deeper bond with you.\nSo—if time is a circle, then you are my freedom.\nAnd you are my fate.\n\u0026ldquo;The way you come close to me is the way I feel understood even when I don’t speak.\u0026rdquo;\n— Franz Kafka to Milena Jesenská, Letters to Milena （online chinese version）\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/en/posts/random/mental-cache/r8/","summary":"Soulless minds are all the same, but beautiful faces come in all forms.","title":"YOU ARE MY ZING"},{"content":"Book Recommendation: Molecular Driving Forces: Statistical Thermodynamics in Chemistry and Biology by Ken Dill, Sarina Bromberg\nFrom Nov 2024 to the early Feb 2025, I read Molecular Driving Forces, and I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the physical basis of biology and chemistry.\nThis book is like a more advanced version of Protein Actions, focusing on statistical thermodynamics and the molecular forces that govern biological systems.\nPersonally, I did my undergraduate studies at Lanzhou University, and the math I learned there is more than enough to understand this book.

This phenomenon stems from binding as a dynamic process governed by populations in equilibrium, where the binding site\u0026rsquo;s shape is influenced by the ligand. All proteins, whether specific or not, exist as ensembles of substates. If enough ligands are present in solution, favorable matches with varying shapes and sizes can bind, causing a redistribution of protein populations. Point mutations at distant sites can induce large conformational changes and hinge effects, shifting populations and potentially leading to drug resistance. Similar effects are seen in protein superfamilies with shared topology but different specificities. Thus, binding site shape and size are defined by the ligand and cannot be analyzed independently. Proteins present a dynamic distribution of binding site shapes to incoming ligands, explaining how specific binding proteins can interact with multiple ligands. This concept has implications for drug design, supporting the need for more diverse molecules and flexible docking approaches.\nNotes 1. General Principles Proteins are classified as specific or broad-range binders, but both cases reflect conformational distribution and hinge-bending motions around native states. Binding principles apply to both selective and broad ligand recognition. Proteins exist as conformational populations influenced by topology, residue type, and ligand presence. Mutations and ligand binding shift conformational populations. 2. Dynamic Nature of Binding Binding involves side-chain movements and hinge-bending, even if not always visible in structural comparisons. Hinge bending allows a variety of conformations separated by low-energy barriers. Binding of different ligands with various sizes and shapes suggests hinge-type motions facilitate adaptability. Specific proteins also exhibit multiple conformations, with domain movements allowing adaptable binding. Ligands can shift equilibrium toward favorable conformers, enabling binding even if transient in the unbound state. 3. Binding Site Structure and Ligand Dependence Binding site shape and size are ligand-defined, not intrinsic to the protein alone. Proteins present a range of conformers, and the best-matching one binds the ligand. Unbound crystal structures capture only one of many possible conformations. Binding relies on both geometry and polar residue hotspots, facilitating hydrogen bonding and complementarity. 4. Conformational Ensembles and Mutation Effects Conformational space is unevenly populated, driven by protein topology. Mutations shift population distributions, rather than creating new motions. Certain regions (hinges) consistently exhibit motion, regardless of mutation sites. Binding site variability allows diverse ligand binding and is fine-tuned by topology and flexibility. 5. Stability and Function Structural stability is unevenly distributed: some regions are prone to unfolding, creating conformational diversity. Mutations that increase stability (Shoichet et al., T4 lysozyme) can reduce activity, showing flexibility is crucial for function. Binding sites have both low and high stability regions (Freire et al.). Low-stability loops play roles in allostery and functional dynamics. COREX algorithm shows binding sites as dual-nature regions — dynamic yet partially stable. Conformational substates at low-stability regions impact ligand variability, but usually on smaller scales than hinge motions. 6. About Phosphorylation and Conformational Shifts (Kern, 2001) Phosphorylation shifts populations, stabilizing active-like states. Active-like species constitute only 2%-10% of unphosphorylated molecules. Unphosphorylated proteins are more dynamic, while phosphorylation stabilizes specific conformers. Side-chain motions remain rapid even after phosphorylation. Phosphorylation promotes oligomerization, enabling sigmoidal activity curves. Complex formation involves cascading redistribution of conformers. 7. Binding Mechanisms and Multi-Ligand Binding Single-site proteins bind ligands via collision and diffusion, saturating at high ligand concentrations. Multivalent proteins engage in cascading conformational redistribution — binding at one site influences others, enhancing overall binding with increased ligand. Residues like glycine, promoting flexibility, may be targeted to modulate stability and binding efficiency. 8. Take-home Concept Binding sites are defined by ligands, not fixed by the protein. Proteins are dynamic distributions, sampling a range of conformers that ligands can select from. Mutations, environment, and ligands all shift these conformational populations. Hinge-bending motions and dynamic ensembles underpin diverse ligand binding. Protein-ligand interaction is a matter of population redistribution, not simple induced fit or lock-and-key.

Binding mechanisms range from ordered folding-upon-binding to fuzzy complexes, where IDPs retain flexibility during interactions. Fuzzy complex: interaction that does not adopt a single static conformation, but remains as an ensemble of transient states, enabling regulatory adaptability. Fuzzy logic analogy: Unlike binary interactions (0 or 1), binding can vary in strength, duration, and conformation — \u0026ldquo;answers\u0026rdquo; can be in between, not fixed. Main Findings ⚙️ 1. Four Types of IDP Complexes 1.1 Simple Two-State Binding Direct, static binding: one site, two states — free or bound. Example: PUMA binding MCL-1, where IDP folds upon binding. Binding is driven by specific interactions and lacks intermediate conformations. 1.2 Avidity Cooperative binding: multiple sites on IDP engage receptor simultaneously. Once one site binds, others follow, increasing overall affinity. Example: antibody-antigen binding. Reduced entropic cost due to spatial proximity. 1.3 Allovalency Multiple identical motifs on IDP binding a single receptor site. Example: Sic1 binding Cdc4 via phosphorylated degrons. Enhances affinity by increasing binding opportunities — repeated interactions. 1.4 Fuzzy Complex Multiple dynamic, transient interactions on both IDP and receptor. No single conformation dominates; a fluctuating ensemble of contacts. Binding and unbinding occur continuously (\u0026ldquo;on the fly\u0026rdquo;). Allows high affinity but short individual interaction lifetimes. Can integrate post-translational modifications (PTMs) dynamically, regulating function in real-time. Unlike allovalency (identical repeats), fuzzy binding involves diverse sub-sites interacting variably. ⚙️ 2. Functional and Biological Significance of Fuzziness Adaptability: IDPs can modulate interactions rapidly via PTMs, even when bound. Signal integration: flexible binding enables response to multiple signals, via dynamic interaction sites. Noise tolerance: flexible binding can filter biological noise while maintaining functional outcomes. Rheostat behavior: degree of interaction strength/frequency can fine-tune signaling output. Biological outcome clarity: Despite fuzziness, functional output is robust and defined, distinguishing fuzzy complexes from nonspecific interactions. Cool and Notable Insights NMR studies showed that fuzzy complexes can form without detectable spectral shifts — indicating binding occurs without large conformational changes. Fuzzy complexes highlight a new form of binding regulation, where affinity does not predict rigidity, and low-affinity interactions can still be functional.

Binding mechanisms range from ordered folding-upon-binding to fuzzy complexes, where IDPs retain flexibility during interactions. Fuzzy complex: interaction that does not adopt a single static conformation, but remains as an ensemble of transient states, enabling regulatory adaptability. Fuzzy logic analogy: Unlike binary interactions (0 or 1), binding can vary in strength, duration, and conformation — \u0026ldquo;answers\u0026rdquo; can be in between, not fixed. Main Findings ⚙️ 1. Four Types of IDP Complexes 1.1 Simple Two-State Binding Direct, static binding: one site, two states — free or bound. Example: PUMA binding MCL-1, where IDP folds upon binding. Binding is driven by specific interactions and lacks intermediate conformations. 1.2 Avidity Cooperative binding: multiple sites on IDP engage receptor simultaneously. Once one site binds, others follow, increasing overall affinity. Example: antibody-antigen binding. Reduced entropic cost due to spatial proximity. 1.3 Allovalency Multiple identical motifs on IDP binding a single receptor site. Example: Sic1 binding Cdc4 via phosphorylated degrons. Enhances affinity by increasing binding opportunities — repeated interactions. 1.4 Fuzzy Complex Multiple dynamic, transient interactions on both IDP and receptor. No single conformation dominates; a fluctuating ensemble of contacts. Binding and unbinding occur continuously (\u0026ldquo;on the fly\u0026rdquo;). Allows high affinity but short individual interaction lifetimes. Can integrate post-translational modifications (PTMs) dynamically, regulating function in real-time. Unlike allovalency (identical repeats), fuzzy binding involves diverse sub-sites interacting variably. ⚙️ 2. Functional and Biological Significance of Fuzziness Adaptability: IDPs can modulate interactions rapidly via PTMs, even when bound. Signal integration: flexible binding enables response to multiple signals, via dynamic interaction sites. Noise tolerance: flexible binding can filter biological noise while maintaining functional outcomes. Rheostat behavior: degree of interaction strength/frequency can fine-tune signaling output. Biological outcome clarity: Despite fuzziness, functional output is robust and defined, distinguishing fuzzy complexes from nonspecific interactions. Cool and Notable Insights NMR studies showed that fuzzy complexes can form without detectable spectral shifts — indicating binding occurs without large conformational changes. Fuzzy complexes highlight a new form of binding regulation, where affinity does not predict rigidity, and low-affinity interactions can still be functional. All complexes above 0K (physiological temperature) exhibit some degree of fuzziness — complete rigidity is an exception, not the norm. Fuzziness enables IDPs to function as \u0026ldquo;rheostats\u0026rdquo;, finely adjusting biological signals rather than acting as simple on/off switches.

General Summary The study addresses why amphiphilic lipopeptides like ANCH insert into membranes — and finds that this process is driven by enthalpic forces, not merely entropy. Van der Waals (vdW) interactions between ANCH lipid tails and membrane lipids are the main contributors to the favorable energy. Conformational selection allows ANCH to sample membrane-competent conformers in water, reducing the cost of structural rearrangement upon insertion. Total transfer free energy of insertion is about −13 kcal/mol, reflecting a balance of opposing entropic and enthalpic contributions. 2. Thermodynamic Dissection of Insertion Favorable terms: ANCH-membrane interaction energy (~−136 kcal/mol), primarily vdW (three-fourths of total), plus minor Coulombic contributions. Opposing terms: Solvation free energy (~+87 kcal/mol): cost of desolvating ANCH from water. Conformational entropy loss (~+36 kcal/mol): cost of restricting ANCH\u0026rsquo;s flexible structure upon insertion. Net free energy: After accounting for all factors, the membrane partition is still favorable (~−13 kcal/mol). 3. Structural and Energetic Insights vdW forces dominate: ANCH\u0026rsquo;s lipid tails (HD186, Palm181, Palm184) interact deeply with the membrane. Conformational selection: Some ANCH conformers in water already resemble bound states, minimizing rearrangement costs. Tail rearrangement: HD186 shows the most significant extension (12 Å to 18 Å) — critical for membrane contact. Restructuring incurs an entropy penalty (~9 kcal/mol), but preselection of extended conformations reduces this cost. Compact-to-extended transition: In water, ANCH’s lipid tails are coiled (compact), while in the membrane, they unwind to interact with lipids. Interaction breakdown: ~75% of binding energy from vdW. Remainder from electrostatic (Coulombic) interactions. Reorganization costs: ~59 kcal/mol needed for ANCH conformational rearrangement, largely due to entropy (~31 kcal/mol) and vdW adjustments. 4. Broader Implications: Revisiting the Hydrophobic Effect Traditional view: Hydrophobic insertion is entropy-driven via release of ordered water molecules. This study: Amphiphilic peptides like ANCH exhibit enthalpy-driven insertion, primarily via vdW contacts, challenging the classical view. Entropy: Insertion reduces configurational freedom, resulting in unfavorable entropy, but enthalpic gain outweighs this cost. Hydrophobic effect redefined: In lipid-modified proteins, enthalpic interactions (vdW, membrane packing) are more critical than solvent reorganization alone. 5. RD\u0026rsquo;s Notes and Learnings RD appreciates the shift from viewing membrane insertion as purely entropy-driven to recognizing strong enthalpic contributions. Conformational selection as a mechanism — important insight, paralleling ideas from protein-ligand binding and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs).

General Summary The study aims to predict whether a protein will be folded or natively unfolded based solely on its amino acid sequence. Introduces charge-hydrophobicity phase space as a predictive framework for protein structural state. Establishes a simple empirical formula to distinguish between folded and unfolded proteins. 2. Key Features of Natively Unfolded Proteins High net charge: Many uncompensated charged groups (especially negative), leading to extreme isoelectric points (pI) near neutral pH. Low hydrophobicity: Fewer hydrophobic residues, reducing the driving force for folding. Highly flexible and dynamic, preventing stable ordered structures under physiological conditions. 3. Main Findings Analysis of 91 natively unfolded proteins: Wide variability in sequence length (~50–1827 residues), net charges (+59 to −117), and pI (range pH 3–13, peaks around 4 and 10.5).

General Summary The study aims to predict whether a protein will be folded or natively unfolded based solely on its amino acid sequence. Introduces charge-hydrophobicity phase space as a predictive framework for protein structural state. Establishes a simple empirical formula to distinguish between folded and unfolded proteins. 2. Key Features of Natively Unfolded Proteins High net charge: Many uncompensated charged groups (especially negative), leading to extreme isoelectric points (pI) near neutral pH. Low hydrophobicity: Fewer hydrophobic residues, reducing the driving force for folding. Highly flexible and dynamic, preventing stable ordered structures under physiological conditions. 3. Main Findings Analysis of 91 natively unfolded proteins: Wide variability in sequence length (~50–1827 residues), net charges (+59 to −117), and pI (range pH 3–13, peaks around 4 and 10.5).

High κ (∼1): Charge clusters, promoting compact, hairpin-like conformations via electrostatic attractions. 3. Key Findings Weak polyampholytes (low FCR): Favor globular structures. Strong polyampholytes (high FCR): Conformation depends on κ: Low κ: Extended conformations, resembling random coils. High κ: Compact, folded-like structures via charge clustering. NCPR alone is insufficient to explain IDP structure — sequence-specific charge patterning is necessary. Scaling theory links κ, FCR, NCPR to IDP ensemble properties. 4. Conceptual and Theoretical Implications The study brings a polymer physics framework to IDP analysis. Charge patterning (κ) adds sequence-level granularity to IDP conformational predictions. Naturally occurring IDPs typically exhibit low κ, suggesting evolutionary bias toward dynamic, flexible random coil ensembles for functional versatility. κ-based design can be used to engineer IDPs with tailored conformational properties—potentially useful for synthetic biology or therapeutic applications. 5. RD\u0026rsquo;s Notes and Takeaways RD recognizes the need to study polymer physics to fully understand IDP behaviors like globule-coil transitions. The introduction of κ is conceptually powerful, adding a new dimension to IDP sequence analysis beyond NCPR and FCR. κ could be incorporated into RD\u0026rsquo;s analysis pipelines for predicting IDP structural tendencies from sequence. The connection between charge segregation and conformation offers insights into designing IDPs for specific binding and functional roles. RD sees potential for using κ to analyze existing IDR datasets, especially when NCPR doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain conformational tendencies. Take-home Messages Charge patterning (κ) crucially determines IDP conformations beyond simple net charge considerations. Low κ (well-mixed charges): Favor extended, random coil ensembles. High κ (charge-segregated): Favor compact, folded-like (hairpin) conformations. NCPR and FCR are important but insufficient — sequence patterning is critical.

High κ (∼1): Charge clusters, promoting compact, hairpin-like conformations via electrostatic attractions. 3. Key Findings Weak polyampholytes (low FCR): Favor globular structures. Strong polyampholytes (high FCR): Conformation depends on κ: Low κ: Extended conformations, resembling random coils. High κ: Compact, folded-like structures via charge clustering. NCPR alone is insufficient to explain IDP structure — sequence-specific charge patterning is necessary. Scaling theory links κ, FCR, NCPR to IDP ensemble properties. 4. Conceptual and Theoretical Implications The study brings a polymer physics framework to IDP analysis. Charge patterning (κ) adds sequence-level granularity to IDP conformational predictions. Naturally occurring IDPs typically exhibit low κ, suggesting evolutionary bias toward dynamic, flexible random coil ensembles for functional versatility. κ-based design can be used to engineer IDPs with tailored conformational properties—potentially useful for synthetic biology or therapeutic applications. 5. RD\u0026rsquo;s Notes and Takeaways RD recognizes the need to study polymer physics to fully understand IDP behaviors like globule-coil transitions. The introduction of κ is conceptually powerful, adding a new dimension to IDP sequence analysis beyond NCPR and FCR. κ could be incorporated into RD\u0026rsquo;s analysis pipelines for predicting IDP structural tendencies from sequence. The connection between charge segregation and conformation offers insights into designing IDPs for specific binding and functional roles. RD sees potential for using κ to analyze existing IDR datasets, especially when NCPR doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain conformational tendencies. Take-home Messages Charge patterning (κ) crucially determines IDP conformations beyond simple net charge considerations. Low κ (well-mixed charges): Favor extended, random coil ensembles. High κ (charge-segregated): Favor compact, folded-like (hairpin) conformations. NCPR and FCR are important but insufficient — sequence patterning is critical. Study bridges polymer physics and IDP biology, offering a predictive framework for IDP structural behavior based on sequence properties. Understanding and manipulating κ enables control over IDP conformations, relevant for both biological function and biotechnological applications.

Binding specificity for Ca²⁺ over Mg²⁺, despite high cellular Mg²⁺ concentration, achieved via geometry and dehydration energy differences. 2. Structural Principles of EF-hand Canonical EF-loops: 12 residues, coordinating Ca²⁺ in pentagonal bipyramidal geometry (7 oxygen ligands). Five ligands from loop, two from adjacent residues. Aspartic acid often involved due to smaller side chain, favoring tight coordination. Non-canonical EF-loops: Modified ligand set or loop length (e.g., Asp replacing Glu at position 12, use of water molecules). Alternative coordination geometries (e.g., octahedral in ALG-2). 3. EF-hand Pairing and Cooperativity EF-hands usually paired, forming four-helix bundles with binding sites ~11 Å apart. Pairs can exhibit positive cooperativity, enhancing Ca²⁺ sensitivity—especially in sensors like CaM, TnC. Antiparallel β-sheets and interhelical contacts stabilize pairs, mediating binding communication. Positive cooperativity mechanisms: First Ca²⁺ binding stabilizes the β-sheet, creating a favorable environment for second binding. Structural reorganization of helices enhances second site affinity. 4. Conformational Dynamics upon Ca²⁺ Binding Conformational changes vary by protein function: Sensors: Transition from closed to open, exposing hydrophobic sites for target binding (e.g., CaM). Buffers: Minimal structural change; maintain closed conformation (e.g., calbindin). Others like S100 adjust interhelical angles; recoverin undergoes domain rotation. Dynamic plasticity allows flexibility for target interaction, stabilized by Ca²⁺. 5. Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ Selectivity and Dual Metal Binding EF-hands distinguish Ca²⁺ vs. Mg²⁺ based on: Coordination geometry: Ca²⁺ accommodates flexible arrangements; Mg²⁺ requires rigid octahedral coordination. Dehydration cost: Mg²⁺ harder to desolvate, less favorable. Ligand flexibility: Twelfth residue (often Glu) adapts to bind Ca²⁺ (bidentate) or Mg²⁺ (monodentate). Mg²⁺ roles: Maintain structure in absence of Ca²⁺ (e.g., parvalbumin, calmodulin). Modulate Ca²⁺ affinity and signaling responsiveness. Functional roles: In DREAM (DNA binding), CaV1.2 channel (stress response inhibition). 6. Ca²⁺ Binding Mechanisms and Energetics Entropic contribution: Water release upon Ca²⁺ binding increases system entropy. Enthalpic contribution: Electrostatic interactions between Ca²⁺ and ligands. Hydrogen bonds stabilizing the bound state. Helical packing enhancing the binding site\u0026rsquo;s rigidity. Stability differences: Unstable apo states drive high Ca²⁺ affinity via larger ΔG. Example: Calmodulin N-/C-terminal domains show differing Ca²⁺ affinities due to intrinsic stability. 7. Functional Implications of Cooperativity and Target Interactions Positive cooperativity enhances sensitivity to Ca²⁺ concentration changes—crucial for rapid signaling. Cooperativity mechanisms: β-sheet formation stabilizes first binding. Interhelical interactions transmit binding state information. Independent vs. cooperative binding: Independent: CaVP, CIB—each EF-hand binds Ca²⁺ independently. Sequential cooperative: sTnC, recoverin—first site binding enhances second site affinity. Target interactions modulate affinity: Target binding stabilizes Ca²⁺-bound state, reduces dissociation (e.g., CaM). Can either enhance or reduce affinity depending on regulatory needs. 8. RD\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts and Takeaways RD appreciates the mechanistic depth in explaining EF-hand diversity and adaptability. The balance of entropic/enthalpic contributions makes EF-hands finely tuned Ca²⁺ sensors. The discussion on Mg²⁺ competition and dual-binding sites is particularly insightful for interpreting EF-hand function in different environments. Structural flexibility and conformational plasticity are crucial for EF-hands acting as multi-functional signaling hubs. RD finds the exploration of positive cooperativity and its structural basis useful for understanding Ca²⁺ signal transduction. Take-home Messages EF-hands are versatile, dynamic Ca²⁺-binding motifs, integral to cellular signaling.

This paper identifies a single residue located in the kinase activation segment, immediately following the conserved DFG motif — termed the \u0026ldquo;DFG+1\u0026rdquo; residue — as a major determinant of this specificity.\nMutation of this DFG+1 residue is sufficient to switch phosphorylation site preference between Ser and Thr in multiple kinases (e.g., PAK4 and MST4). Structural studies show that phosphoacceptor residue preference is driven by conformational compatibility rather than binding strength, explaining how subtle differences between Ser and Thr determine kinase substrate selectivity.\nNotes 1. Background and General Concept Kinase substrate specificity is influenced by multiple mechanisms: Colocalization, scaffold proteins, adaptor units, direct interactions. Ser-Thr kinases (80% of human kinome) usually have conserved active site residues suited for these residues. Some kinases prefer Ser (e.g., PKA), others prefer Thr (e.g., LKB1), and some show no preference. The \u0026ldquo;DFG+1\u0026rdquo; residue in the activation segment is now identified as a key determinant for Ser/Thr preference. 2. Main Findings The DFG+1 residue strongly influences kinase phosphoacceptor specificity. Ser-specific kinases (e.g., PAK4) have large hydrophobic residues at DFG+1 (e.g., Phe, Leu, Met). Thr-specific kinases (e.g., MST4) often have β-branched residues (e.g., Ile). Non-selective kinases usually have smaller residues (e.g., Leu, Ser). Experimental Highlights: Mutating DFG+1 switches kinase preference: PAK4 (Ser-specific) F461V mutation turns it into Thr-specific. MST4 (Thr-specific) V165F mutation makes it Ser-specific. Tested in multiple kinases: MST, PAK, Snf1, PKA — consistent shift in specificity. Even predicts ROCK1\u0026rsquo;s Thr preference, an outlier in AGC family. 3.

This paper identifies a single residue located in the kinase activation segment, immediately following the conserved DFG motif — termed the \u0026ldquo;DFG+1\u0026rdquo; residue — as a major determinant of this specificity.\nMutation of this DFG+1 residue is sufficient to switch phosphorylation site preference between Ser and Thr in multiple kinases (e.g., PAK4 and MST4). Structural studies show that phosphoacceptor residue preference is driven by conformational compatibility rather than binding strength, explaining how subtle differences between Ser and Thr determine kinase substrate selectivity.\nNotes 1. Background and General Concept Kinase substrate specificity is influenced by multiple mechanisms: Colocalization, scaffold proteins, adaptor units, direct interactions. Ser-Thr kinases (80% of human kinome) usually have conserved active site residues suited for these residues. Some kinases prefer Ser (e.g., PKA), others prefer Thr (e.g., LKB1), and some show no preference. The \u0026ldquo;DFG+1\u0026rdquo; residue in the activation segment is now identified as a key determinant for Ser/Thr preference. 2. Main Findings The DFG+1 residue strongly influences kinase phosphoacceptor specificity. Ser-specific kinases (e.g., PAK4) have large hydrophobic residues at DFG+1 (e.g., Phe, Leu, Met). Thr-specific kinases (e.g., MST4) often have β-branched residues (e.g., Ile). Non-selective kinases usually have smaller residues (e.g., Leu, Ser). Experimental Highlights: Mutating DFG+1 switches kinase preference: PAK4 (Ser-specific) F461V mutation turns it into Thr-specific. MST4 (Thr-specific) V165F mutation makes it Ser-specific. Tested in multiple kinases: MST, PAK, Snf1, PKA — consistent shift in specificity. Even predicts ROCK1\u0026rsquo;s Thr preference, an outlier in AGC family. 3.

The energy landscape is smoothed, making folding transitions more feasible and reducing the risk of misfolding or aggregation.\nBy introducing protein games, the authors propose that folding and binding are dynamic negotiations, where proteins adjust each other\u0026rsquo;s landscapes, and water and chaperones act as diffuse, fluctuating modulators in these molecular \u0026ldquo;games.\u0026rdquo;\nNotes 1. Water and Chaperones: Weak but Essential Players Water molecules transiently form hydrogen bonds with backbone and side chains, introducing fluctuations that lower activation barriers, enabling otherwise restricted conformational changes. Chaperones provide flexible interactions: Passive mode: Prevent aggregation by shielding hydrophobic regions. Active mode: Use ATP to iteratively unfold and refold proteins (iterative annealing), creating repeated opportunities for correct folding. Both act as \u0026ldquo;weak links\u0026rdquo; — transient, low-affinity, but crucial to guide folding and refolding. 2. Energy Landscape Smoothing and Punctuated Equilibrium Folding is hierarchical: rapid collapse, followed by slower core organization. Proteins face conformational traps, stabilized misfolds difficult to escape. Water and chaperones lower activation energies, smoothing pathways and rescuing trapped conformers. Without these weak links, folding may stall or result in nonfunctional forms. Punctuated equilibrium: Folding involves many small adjustments punctuated by rare, large \u0026ldquo;protein quakes\u0026rdquo; — sudden structural relaxations when tension builds. Water and chaperones reduce the size and frequency of these quakes, making folding a smoother journey. 💡 Fancy thought: Protein folding is not only physics but a \u0026ldquo;regulated negotiation\u0026rdquo; shaped by the environment. 3. Protein Games: Applying Game Theory to Folding and Interactions Proteins continuously adjust each other\u0026rsquo;s landscapes during interaction, negotiating conformations until a stable complex forms. This interaction can be viewed through game theory: Each protein adapts dynamically, balancing its own energy landscape against that of its partner. Examples: domain swapping, fly-casting, and conformational selection. Water and chaperones are mediators in these games, facilitating or buffering interactions to avoid \u0026ldquo;failed negotiations\u0026rdquo; (misfolding or aggregation). 4. Role of Water in Fine-tuning Folding and Interaction Water regulates internal hydration, preventing over-rigidity while ensuring structural stability. Water expulsion is essential, but some water must remain, creating internal \u0026ldquo;wet\u0026rdquo; networks stabilizing the native fold. Incorrect water balance leads to misfolding or loss of necessary flexibility. 5. Chaperones as Dynamic Modulators Chaperones reshape protein energy landscapes actively and passively: By reintroducing water molecules where needed. By forcing protein parts to unfold and refold, exploring alternative pathways out of folding traps. Iterative cycles allow proteins to gradually approach native state, rather than being forced into a potentially wrong conformation. Chaperones and water work together, as part of a cooperative network, not as isolated helpers. 6. Conceptual Highlights Protein folding is a networked process, embedded in a fluctuating environment of weak interactions. Energy landscapes are dynamic and negotiable, not fixed — water and chaperones act as landscape modulating agents. Game theory of proteins offers a way to conceptualize how proteins \u0026ldquo;decide\u0026rdquo; on folding paths and interactions. Protein-quakes and punctuated equilibria describe the discontinuous yet regulated nature of conformational transitions.

Energy landscapes are shaped by environment, and folding involves negotiation, not just internal rules. Game theory offers a fresh lens to understand how proteins interact and fold cooperatively, balancing internal and external constraints. Chaperones smooth energy barriers, prevent aggregation, and allow safe exploration of conformational space.

Energy Landscape Smoothing and Punctuated Equilibrium Folding is hierarchical: rapid collapse, followed by slower core organization. Proteins face conformational traps, stabilized misfolds difficult to escape. Water and chaperones lower activation energies, smoothing pathways and rescuing trapped conformers. Without these weak links, folding may stall or result in nonfunctional forms. Punctuated equilibrium: Folding involves many small adjustments punctuated by rare, large \u0026ldquo;protein quakes\u0026rdquo; — sudden structural relaxations when tension builds. Water and chaperones reduce the size and frequency of these quakes, making folding a smoother journey. 💡 Fancy thought: Protein folding is not only physics but a \u0026ldquo;regulated negotiation\u0026rdquo; shaped by the environment. 3. Protein Games: Applying Game Theory to Folding and Interactions Proteins continuously adjust each other\u0026rsquo;s landscapes during interaction, negotiating conformations until a stable complex forms. This interaction can be viewed through game theory: Each protein adapts dynamically, balancing its own energy landscape against that of its partner. Examples: domain swapping, fly-casting, and conformational selection. Water and chaperones are mediators in these games, facilitating or buffering interactions to avoid \u0026ldquo;failed negotiations\u0026rdquo; (misfolding or aggregation). 4. Role of Water in Fine-tuning Folding and Interaction Water regulates internal hydration, preventing over-rigidity while ensuring structural stability. Water expulsion is essential, but some water must remain, creating internal \u0026ldquo;wet\u0026rdquo; networks stabilizing the native fold. Incorrect water balance leads to misfolding or loss of necessary flexibility. 5. Chaperones as Dynamic Modulators Chaperones reshape protein energy landscapes actively and passively: By reintroducing water molecules where needed. By forcing protein parts to unfold and refold, exploring alternative pathways out of folding traps. Iterative cycles allow proteins to gradually approach native state, rather than being forced into a potentially wrong conformation. Chaperones and water work together, as part of a cooperative network, not as isolated helpers. 6. Conceptual Highlights Protein folding is a networked process, embedded in a fluctuating environment of weak interactions. Energy landscapes are dynamic and negotiable, not fixed — water and chaperones act as landscape modulating agents. Game theory of proteins offers a way to conceptualize how proteins \u0026ldquo;decide\u0026rdquo; on folding paths and interactions. Protein-quakes and punctuated equilibria describe the discontinuous yet regulated nature of conformational transitions. Iterative annealing: A practical mechanism for chaperone-assisted folding — repetitive cycles driving proteins out of traps and toward functionality. Take-home Messages Protein folding is not solitary — it\u0026rsquo;s a community effort, supported by water and chaperones as weak, dynamic partners. Energy landscapes are shaped by environment, and folding involves negotiation, not just internal rules. Game theory offers a fresh lens to understand how proteins interact and fold cooperatively, balancing internal and external constraints. Chaperones smooth energy barriers, prevent aggregation, and allow safe exploration of conformational space. Folding, like life, is full of weak links — and without them, nothing would work properly. ⚡️ Final Thought: Protein folding and interaction are not deterministic but dynamic games — shaped by weak, fluctuating partners like water and chaperones.\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/zh/posts_zh/%E7%95%8C%E9%99%90%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%96/36/","summary":"\u003cstrong\u003eA conceptual leap\u003c/strong\u003e in understanding protein folding, showing how \u003cstrong\u003ewater molecules and molecular chaperones\u003c/strong\u003e act as \u003cstrong\u003eweak, transient links\u003c/strong\u003e that \u003cstrong\u003esmooth energy landscapes\u003c/strong\u003e and prevent conformational traps.

Energy landscapes for proteins, glasses, and other systems can be analyzed as networks, facilitating understanding of folding, phase transitions, and dynamics. Global optimization becomes more efficient on scale-free landscapes, as hubs (low-energy states) guide search pathways. Insight into glass transitions and other non-equilibrium phenomena through energy landscape connectivity. 4. RD\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts and Learnings RD loves this paper — the concept of static networks behaving like scale-free structures is profound and surprising. Understanding PELs as networks could redefine approaches to complex system dynamics, including protein folding and material science. The funnel-like organization as a natural result of topology is a powerful insight for optimization algorithms. RD sees potential to apply similar concepts to residue interaction networks and phosphorylation landscapes in biology. The interplay of energy, structure, and network theory is elegant and compelling. Take-home Messages Potential energy landscapes can be understood as scale-free, small-world networks — a static but highly organized system. Low-energy minima serve as hubs, facilitating efficient transitions and global optimization. Topology and topography are intertwined: the shape of basins determines the network connections. The scale-free nature of ISNs opens pathways to better modeling of folding, dynamics, and phase transitions. RD finds this paper inspiring and foundational — it provides a new lens for viewing complex energy landscapes.

Key Findings 2.1 Structural Impact Phosphorylation of Thr induces compact, ordered structures, especially in the dianionic state (pThr²⁻). Three key noncovalent interactions stabilize pThr: Phosphate-amide hydrogen bond n → π* between carbonyls n → σ* between phosphate oxygen and side-chain C–Hβ pThr mimics proline-like cyclic constraints but via noncovalent interactions, unlike Pro\u0026rsquo;s covalent cyclization.

Myr-GCN4-ICM (forced dimer) High constitutive activity, dimerization-induced. Myr-ICM with flexible linker Still inhibited — c-Src motif unlikely to explain inhibition.

Membrane Interaction as Autoinhibitory Mechanism Condition Observation TM + JM-A + ICM constructs Inhibited when membrane-tethered, active in solution. Membrane charge Lipid composition modulates EGFR conformation — more anionic lipids favor active dimer (see Arkhipov et al., 2013). Membrane imposes autoinhibition, reversed by ligand-induced TM and JM-A rearrangement.\n8. Conceptual Model of EGFR Activation Step Description 1. Resting state Monomeric EGFR, extracellular domain tethers TM/JM, preventing dimerization. 2. Ligand binding Induces ECD dimerization, freeing TM for N-terminal dimerization. 3.

Key Insights \u0026amp; Broader Implications Activation depends on precise transmembrane and juxtamembrane interactions, not just ligand-induced dimerization. Membrane attachment of ICM strongly inhibits dimerization — highlighting membrane as active regulator.

Water accessibility TM-JM interaction occurs outside lipid bilayer, suggesting coupling extends beyond membrane. TM N-terminal dimerization drives JM-A antiparallel dimer, critical for kinase activation.\n6. Functional Mutations: Role of TM Dimerization Motif Mutation Effect I640E Disrupts N-terminal TM dimerization, inhibits EGFR activation. Mechanism I640E favors C-terminal TM dimer, incompatible with JM-A dimer — blocks asymmetric kinase dimer formation. N-terminal TM dimerization motif essential for JM-A dimerization and activation.\n7. Membrane Interaction as Autoinhibitory Mechanism Condition Observation TM + JM-A + ICM constructs Inhibited when membrane-tethered, active in solution. Membrane charge Lipid composition modulates EGFR conformation — more anionic lipids favor active dimer (see Arkhipov et al., 2013). Membrane imposes autoinhibition, reversed by ligand-induced TM and JM-A rearrangement.\n8. Conceptual Model of EGFR Activation Step Description 1. Resting state Monomeric EGFR, extracellular domain tethers TM/JM, preventing dimerization. 2. Ligand binding Induces ECD dimerization, freeing TM for N-terminal dimerization. 3. TM dimerization Facilitates JM-A antiparallel dimer, stabilizing asymmetric kinase dimer. 4. Activation Asymmetric dimer activates kinase domains, leading to trans-autophosphorylation. 9. Key Insights \u0026amp; Broader Implications Activation depends on precise transmembrane and juxtamembrane interactions, not just ligand-induced dimerization. Membrane attachment of ICM strongly inhibits dimerization — highlighting membrane as active regulator. Conformational coupling across domains is a finely tuned switch regulated by ligand, receptor density, and membrane environment. Potential implications for drug design: targeting TM-JM coupling to modulate EGFR activity in cancers.\n10. Final Reflections Personal notes:\nBeautiful multi-layer mechanism combining membrane physics, structural coupling, and ligand-induced conformational shifts. Ligand-free pre-dimerization may prime receptor — a concept to explore in other RTKs. Inspiration: how biophysics can uncover subtle regulation embedded in membrane architecture. Quote to remember:\n\u0026ldquo;Science is not about truth but about exploring possibilities, making sense of complexity, and having fun understanding nature.\u0026rdquo;\nRD\u0026rsquo;s Note Worth re-reading when focusing on RTK membrane coupling mechanisms. Possible application in studying other receptor systems like VEGFR, FGFR. Consider for future reviews on membrane-tethered kinases and lipid modulation.

You play as three different androids — Connor, Kara, and Markus — each with their own storyline that eventually connects.\nWhat makes this game special is how much control you have over the story.\nAlmost every decision you make — from small conversations to life-and-death moments — shapes the outcome, sometimes in unexpected ways.\nI enjoyed seeing how different dialogue options could lead to completely different scenes, relationships, and endings. It\u0026rsquo;s like playing a movie, but you’re the director of every scene.\nThemes of Humanity and Morality One reason I think Detroit stands out is its philosophical depth. It raises big questions:\nWhat makes someone human? What is freedom? How do we treat those who are \u0026ldquo;different\u0026rdquo;? Even though it\u0026rsquo;s set in a future with androids, the themes feel very relevant to real-life issues — discrimination, freedom, empathy.\nSome scenes, especially involving Kara’s story, were emotionally intense, but not in a forced way — more like quiet reflection on difficult topics.\nThe Gameplay — Simple but Effective The gameplay itself is simple — mostly dialogue choices, quick-time events (QTEs), and exploration — but that works for this type of game.\nThe flowchart system at the end of each chapter was one of my favorite features: it shows all the choices you made and hints at paths you didn’t take.\nIt makes you realize how many possibilities there are, and makes replaying feel meaningful.\nFinal Thoughts If you’re interested in narrative-driven games where your choices matter, Detroit: Become Human is a must-play.\nIt’s not about action or puzzles — it’s about experiencing a story where you shape the lives of its characters.\nI would recommend it to anyone who enjoys games like Life is Strange, Heavy Rain, or even people who love sci-fi and want to explore the ethics of AI and society.\nFor me, Detroit was less about \u0026ldquo;playing a game\u0026rdquo; and more about experiencing an interactive story that stays in your mind long after you finish.\nTags: Detroit: Become Human, Narrative Games, Interactive Story, Game Design, Philosophy in Games\nCategory: Life \u0026gt; Games \u0026gt; Narrative Games\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/en/posts/life/game-log/detroit/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI played \u003cstrong\u003eDetroit: Become Human\u003c/strong\u003e during a quiet period in life, and it left a lasting impression — not because of action or graphics (though both are good), but because of \u003cstrong\u003ehow it handles storytelling and choice-making\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"not-just-a-game-but-an-interactive-story\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot Just a Game, But an Interactive Story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt its core, \u003cem\u003eDetroit: Become Human\u003c/em\u003e is about \u003cstrong\u003echoices and consequences\u003c/strong\u003e.

Final Takeaways and Reflections RK exhibits unique autophosphorylation dynamics that may regulate its membrane interaction and Rho deactivation cycle.*\nHigh specificity and controlled dissociation from Rho through autophosphorylation distinguish RK from other GRKs.*\nStructural and biochemical approaches used (proteolysis, heparin-Sepharose, thio-ATP, synthetic peptides) offer comprehensive insights into RK function.\nPotential broader relevance for other GRKs and GPCR kinases in controlling receptor desensitization and signaling turn-off.\nRD’s Notes Very inspiring use of proteolysis for kinase mapping — great model for studying other multi-site phosphorylated kinases. Notable to consider RK\u0026rsquo;s unique lack of peptide-based inhibition and low autophosphorylation efficiency — reflects divergence in GRK family regulation. Method of manipulating membrane-bound proteins using urea-washed ROS membranes is fascinating — worth applying in other contexts.

Yields accurate models (RMSD ≤ 1.5 Å) validated through multiple structural metrics (Z-DOPE, TM-score). Distinguishes type-II inhibitors from non-binders (AUC \u0026gt; 0.70), suitable for virtual screening. They also provide case studies where DFGmodel predicts off-target interactions and expands structural understanding for drug design.\nNotes 1. General Summary DFGmodel fills a critical gap by predicting kinase inactive (DFG-out) conformations, enabling structure-based type-II inhibitor discovery. Uses comprehensive analysis of kinase structures to inform model building. Applies to both existing active structures and kinase sequences lacking any structure. Achieves high accuracy, making it useful for virtual screening and understanding DFG-flip mechanics. 2. Structural and Modeling Insights DFG-flip involves a 180° flip of the Asp and Phe residues in the DFG motif. DFG-out state shows greater flexibility, especially in the N-lobe and αC-helix, while DFG-in is more compact.

Yields accurate models (RMSD ≤ 1.5 Å) validated through multiple structural metrics (Z-DOPE, TM-score). Distinguishes type-II inhibitors from non-binders (AUC \u0026gt; 0.70), suitable for virtual screening. They also provide case studies where DFGmodel predicts off-target interactions and expands structural understanding for drug design.\nNotes 1. General Summary DFGmodel fills a critical gap by predicting kinase inactive (DFG-out) conformations, enabling structure-based type-II inhibitor discovery. Uses comprehensive analysis of kinase structures to inform model building. Applies to both existing active structures and kinase sequences lacking any structure. Achieves high accuracy, making it useful for virtual screening and understanding DFG-flip mechanics. 2. Structural and Modeling Insights DFG-flip involves a 180° flip of the Asp and Phe residues in the DFG motif. DFG-out state shows greater flexibility, especially in the N-lobe and αC-helix, while DFG-in is more compact. Interestingly, the β-hairpin preceding DFG remains structurally conserved in DFG-out conformations across kinases. The position of the DFG motif may be linked to A-loop conformation, but not necessarily controlling A-loop secondary structure.

By aligning and analyzing multiple kinases, they highlight a conserved set of 30 residues critical for activation, leading to a general model of kinase activation.\nOne of their key contributions is identifying a hydrophobic \u0026ldquo;spine\u0026rdquo;, a structural feature dynamically assembled in active kinases but disordered in inactive forms, which helps coordinate the kinase’s active state.\nPre-knowledge (Kinase Architecture Recap) N-lobe (N-terminal lobe): β-sheet rich, involved in ATP binding. C-lobe (C-terminal lobe): α-helix rich, responsible for substrate binding and catalysis. Key conformational motions: αC-helix reorientation and activation loop movement are crucial for activation. Kinases toggle between open/closed even when active. Critical motifs and elements: K72–E91 salt bridge stabilizes ATP binding. Glycine-rich loop positions γ-phosphate of ATP. DFG motif (Asp-Phe-Gly): coordinates Mg²⁺ and phosphate transfer. HRD motif (His-Arg-Asp) for substrate positioning. Magnesium-binding loop for Mg²⁺ coordination. Activation loop: phosphorylation site, triggers structural rearrangement. Main Findings 30 conserved residues identified across kinases, important for maintaining active conformation. Hydrophobic spine is a critical dynamic structure formed upon activation: Composed of L95, L106, Y164, F185, connecting N- and C-lobes. Present in 23 eukaryotic and prokaryotic kinases — a universal feature. Graph-theoretical method reveals key catalytic residues and previously underappreciated ones: Known: K72, D184 New: A70, L106, involved in critical hydrophobic stacking. Glycine Swing — A Mechanism for Inactivation The DFG glycine (G186) exhibits a conformational twist (glycine swing) when the kinase is inactive. G186 forms H-bond with K189 to help orient K189 — essential in active state. Upon dephosphorylation of T197, the activation loop destabilizes: DFG-out conformation occurs — glycine swing moves aspartate away from catalytic site. K189 flips away from catalytic center, disrupting active conformation. Activation Mechanism and Structural Insights Phosphorylation of T197 stabilizes the active site by anchoring key residues (R165, K189). L106 creates a critical hydrophobic connection with L95 and DFG-Phe, helping align αC-helix and DFG motif. Spine assembly is central to activation — links N- and C-lobes to allow controlled flexibility. Hydrophobic Interactions Hydrophobic pocket surrounds ATP (L49, F54, V57, etc.). Spine residues: L95, L106, Y164, F185 form a continuous stack stabilizing active conformation. L106\u0026rsquo;s role: overlooked before, connects αC-helix and DFG motif — key for coordinating activation loop and catalytic residues. Why it’s interesting Proposes a universal model for kinase activation based on spine assembly and glycine swing. Graph-theoretical approach gives a systematic way to identify functionally critical residues beyond sequence conservation. Provides a structural explanation for how phosphorylation induces stabilization of the active kinase. Highlights the glycine swing as a potential mechanism of switching between active/inactive states, which could be targeted in kinase drug design. Take-home message Kinase activation involves more than local changes; it reflects global reorganization coordinated by a hydrophobic spine.\nGlycine swing and spine assembly are critical dynamic features enabling allosteric control and catalysis.\nThis study offers a framework to understand activation across kinases and may guide how we think about kinase inhibitors and mutation effects in diseases.\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/en/posts/mind/mindscape/1/","summary":"Notes on 2006_PNAS paper exploring conserved structural mechanisms of kinase activation via surface comparison.","title":"Surface Comparison Reveals Conserved Activation Mechanism in Protein Kinases"},{"content":"Keywords Kinase, PKA, Dynamics, Community, Allostery, Spine, Conformation, MD, DFG, Phosphorylation\nReference DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1418402111\nNotes This paper takes a dynamic look at protein kinase A (PKA) by applying community analysis to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Instead of thinking about PKA as a rigid structure, they map how different parts of the kinase move together — essentially dividing the protein into \u0026ldquo;communities\u0026rdquo; of residues that share correlated motions.\nInterestingly, these communities don\u0026rsquo;t always align with classical sequence or structural motifs. Some well-known motifs are split into different communities, suggesting that functionally, these regions behave in a more modular and dynamic way than static structures might imply.\nWhat they did MD simulations of PKA under four different conditions:\nClosed with ATP + 2 Mg²⁺ Closed with ATP + 1 Mg²⁺ Open with ATP + 1 Mg²⁺ Open without ATP/Mg²⁺ (apo) Used mutual information to identify residue-residue correlated motions.\nApplied Girvan–Newman community detection to partition PKA into dynamic communities.\nKey findings Nine distinct communities were identified in the active (ATP + 2 Mg²⁺) PKA. Each community contains ~40–60 residues, forming dynamic modules. Catalytic residues (K72, D166, N171, D184) are located in different communities, but still functionally connected — showing how function emerges from inter-community dynamics. Community structure is sensitive to ligands and conformational state — ATP and Mg²⁺ binding reorganize the communication network inside PKA. Allosteric communication pathways revealed by this analysis align with known hydrophobic spine architecture, and match mutagenesis data (e.g., mutations like E208-R280 disrupt key community interactions, affecting function/stability). Why it\u0026rsquo;s cool The idea of breaking a kinase into dynamic communities gives a new way to think about long-range communication and allosteric regulation. It shows that allosteric coupling isn\u0026rsquo;t just about static contacts, but about dynamic relationships that shift with ligands and conformation. Also, this method provides a framework to analyze disease mutations that affect distant sites — by seeing which community connections are altered. Take-home message Protein kinases like PKA aren\u0026rsquo;t just collections of static motifs; they\u0026rsquo;re networks of dynamically coupled communities that reshape depending on what\u0026rsquo;s bound.

Unlike metabolic enzymes, EPKs are designed for transient activation and allosteric regulation, supported by conserved hydrophobic \u0026ldquo;spines\u0026rdquo; anchored to the F-helix.\nPre-knowledge: Kinase Evolution and Structure Protein phosphorylation discovered in 1950s; protein kinases like PKA, Src identified as regulators. Hanks and Hunter (1995) classified kinase conserved motifs into 12 subdomains. Eukaryotic kinases (EPKs) are distinguished from prokaryotic kinases (ELKs) by regulation via phosphorylation and signals. Conserved structural elements: Glycine-rich loop, Catalytic loop, P+1 loop, DFG motif. Unique to EPKs: Activation segment, GHI subdomain (substrate docking). Main Findings ⚙️ F-helix as Central Scaffold Anchors both R and C spines. Stabilizes catalytic loop, P+1 loop, activation segment through hydrophobic contacts. D220 (F-helix) serves as electrostatic anchor for HRD motif. ⚙️ Regulatory Spine (R spine) Formed by Leu106 (β4), Leu91 (C-helix), Tyr164 (catalytic loop), Phe185 (activation loop). Anchored to F-helix (D220). Dynamic: assembled in active form, disassembled when inactive. Activation requires R spine assembly via phosphorylation of activation segment. ⚙️ Catalytic Spine (C spine) Completed by ATP adenine ring. Spans N- and C-lobes: N-lobe: Val57 (β2), Ala70 (AxK motif in β3). C-lobe: Leu173 (β7), Leu172/Leu174, Met128 (D-helix), Leu227/Met231 (F-helix). Stabilizes ATP positioning for catalysis. ⚙️ Activation Segment \u0026amp; Regulation Extends from DFG motif to APE motif, includes flexible phosphorylation sites. DFG-in conformation enables Mg²⁺ and ATP binding for activation. DFG-out (inactive): Phe flips, blocking ATP site, breaking R spine. Active form requires: R spine assembled. DFG-in conformation. Correctly positioned C-helix (salt bridge: Lys72–Glu91). ⚙️ GHI Subdomain: Allosteric Regulation \u0026amp; Substrate Docking Unique to EPKs; connects to activation segment via: Glu208 (APE motif). Arg280 (αH-αI loop). Trp222 (F-helix). Stabilizes kinase core; critical for substrate docking and allosteric control. ⚙️ Flexibility \u0026amp; Dynamics of Kinases Unlike metabolic enzymes, kinases are transient, dynamic switches.

General Summary Protein kinases are critical regulatory enzymes, making up ~2% of eukaryotic genomes. Switching between active/inactive states underpins precise control of cellular processes. The catalytic domain consists of a two-lobed structure: N-lobe: binds ATP. C-lobe: catalyzes phosphotransfer. ATP binds in the cleft between lobes, stabilized by the P-loop (Glycine loop). Activation loop phosphorylation triggers conformational changes necessary for catalysis. 2. Structural Insights Active State: Activation loop is phosphorylated, adopting an open conformation to accommodate substrate. αC helix forms an ion pair (Glu91-Lys72) crucial for ATP positioning. Catalytic residues (Asp166, Lys72) properly aligned for phosphotransfer. Inactive States: Diverse conformations depending on interaction with regulatory domains (e.g., SH2/SH3 in Src). Helix αC repositioned, disrupting the ion pair and misaligning catalytic residues. Activation loop can block substrate binding or be trapped in an alternative conformation. Plasticity enables regulation and targeting by inhibitors (e.g., Gleevec binds inactive Abl but not Src). 3. Mechanisms of Regulation Phosphorylation-Dependent Activation: e.g., ERK2, Insulin receptor kinase (IRK) — phosphorylation opens activation loop, stabilizing active conformation. Helix αC Repositioning: Essential for activation loop and ATP positioning. e.g., CDKs require cyclins to reposition αC and activation loop for activation. Pseudosubstrate Inhibition: Intra pseudosubstrate: Autoinhibitory sequences mimic substrates, block active site (e.g., twitchin, PAK). Inter pseudosubstrate: Regulatory proteins provide inhibitory segments (e.g., Rho family GTPases activate PAK by displacing pseudosubstrate). Alternative Inhibitory Segments: e.g., EphB2, TβR-I, use N-terminal inhibitory motifs to prevent catalysis until phosphorylated. 4. Functional Implications Conformational plasticity allows fine-tuned regulation of kinase activity, responding to signals, partners, or inhibitors.

AKAPs (A-kinase anchoring proteins) serve as signal-organizing molecules that localize PKA and other enzymes to specific subcellular sites. AKAPs allow second messenger-regulated enzymes, such as PKA and phosphatases, to act on selected substrates in defined cellular microdomains. Key Points 1. Role of Scaffold and Anchoring Proteins AKAPs target PKA and other signaling enzymes to specific cellular locations. Facilitate precise control over substrate phosphorylation by colocalizing kinases, phosphatases, and substrates. AKAPs compartmentalize signaling, creating focal points for enzyme action. 2. cAMP Signaling and AKAP Function cAMP is produced upon GPCR activation and stimulates PKA. Rather than diffusing uniformly, cAMP forms gradients—AKAPs contribute to this spatial organization. AKAPs ensure local activation of PKA, allowing compartment-specific responses to cAMP. 3. Properties of AKAPs Over 50 members, identified via PKA-binding. Common features: PKA-anchoring domain (amphipathic helix binds PKA R-subunit N-terminal dimerization domain). Localization signals targeting specific subcellular sites. Binding sites for other signaling proteins (e.g., phosphatases, PDEs, kinases). Isoform-specific interactions: most bind RII, some RI, others dual specificity. Peptide inhibitors (e.g., Ht31, AKAP-IS) can disrupt AKAP–PKA binding, enabling experimental manipulation. 4. Combinatorial Assembly of AKAP Complexes AKAPs form dynamic and context-dependent enzyme complexes: Not all binding partners interact simultaneously—context-specific combinations form. Example: AKAP79/150 assembles PKA-PP2B (calcineurin)-PKC complexes, enabling signaling crosstalk. Each AKAP can serve as a multi-enzyme platform, tailoring responses to specific cellular contexts. 5. Compartmentalization \u0026amp; Isoforms AKAP splice variants and isoforms target specific organelles or membranes. Example: Yotiao: anchors PKA to plasma membrane. Longer splice variants: target Golgi or centrosomes. Multiple AKAPs can co-target the same compartments for fine-tuning signaling. 6. Dynamic Reorganization of AKAP Complexes AKAP complexes are not static—they recruit/release partners dynamically. Mechanisms for AKAP complex reorganization: Phosphorylation of AKAPs modulates localization and binding. Reversible lipidation (e.g., palmitoylation) changes membrane association. Competitive binding among interacting proteins. Example: mAKAP complex: PKA phosphorylates PDE4D3, activating it to degrade cAMP → negative feedback loop. AKAP-Lbc complex: PKA phosphorylation recruits 14-3-3, inhibiting AKAP-Lbc\u0026rsquo;s Rho-GEF activity. 7. AKAPs as Signal Integrators AKAPs integrate multiple pathways, coordinating kinases, phosphatases, and second messengers. Crosstalk allows for refined regulation of downstream targets. AKAP complexes provide both signaling amplification and negative feedback. Examples \u0026amp; Highlights WAVE1: Organizes tissue-specific complexes involving PKA. AKAP79/150: Scaffold for PKA, PP2B, PKC, modulating synaptic plasticity. Yotiao: Targets PKA to regulate ion channels at the plasma membrane. AKAP-Lbc: Regulates RhoA signaling via feedback.

Longer splice variants: target Golgi or centrosomes. Multiple AKAPs can co-target the same compartments for fine-tuning signaling. 6. Dynamic Reorganization of AKAP Complexes AKAP complexes are not static—they recruit/release partners dynamically. Mechanisms for AKAP complex reorganization: Phosphorylation of AKAPs modulates localization and binding. Reversible lipidation (e.g., palmitoylation) changes membrane association. Competitive binding among interacting proteins. Example: mAKAP complex: PKA phosphorylates PDE4D3, activating it to degrade cAMP → negative feedback loop. AKAP-Lbc complex: PKA phosphorylation recruits 14-3-3, inhibiting AKAP-Lbc\u0026rsquo;s Rho-GEF activity. 7. AKAPs as Signal Integrators AKAPs integrate multiple pathways, coordinating kinases, phosphatases, and second messengers. Crosstalk allows for refined regulation of downstream targets. AKAP complexes provide both signaling amplification and negative feedback. Examples \u0026amp; Highlights WAVE1: Organizes tissue-specific complexes involving PKA. AKAP79/150: Scaffold for PKA, PP2B, PKC, modulating synaptic plasticity. Yotiao: Targets PKA to regulate ion channels at the plasma membrane. AKAP-Lbc: Regulates RhoA signaling via feedback.

Instead, data are consistent with polymer-specific models where both IDPs and crowding agents are treated as penetrable polymers.\nResults highlight excluded volume interactions, polymeric effects, and suggest a need to revise standard crowding paradigms for IDPs.\nNotes 1. General Summary IDPs often alter their dimensions under crowded conditions, though some remain disordered without gaining structure. PEG polymers used as crowding agents because of their uncharged nature, high solubility, and availability in a wide range of sizes (from monomers to high polymers). Focus on how IDP conformation (especially radius of gyration, Rg) responds to crowder concentration and size. 2. Methodological Approach Single-molecule FRET between Alexa Fluor 488 (donor) and Alexa Fluor 594 (acceptor) labels attached via engineered cysteines to monitor end-to-end distance of IDPs. Used Flory-Fisk distribution to analyze chain conformations under different conditions. Investigated four representative IDPs: Prothymosin-α N-terminal and C-terminal segments (ProTα-N, ProTα-C) — highly charged, remain unfolded. ACTR — binding domain of thyroid hormone/retinoid receptor activator, IDP that folds upon partner binding. IN (HIV-1 integrase N-terminal domain) — folds upon ligand binding. 3. Core Findings and Insights Increasing crowder concentration leads to IDP compaction, observable as reduced Rg via FRET. Larger crowders cause more compaction than smaller ones, at odds with scaled-particle theory, which predicts larger crowders should create larger interstitial spaces. IDPs collapse more with increasing size of the crowders — a surprising and key observation challenging classical models. Introduction of \u0026ldquo;Gaussian cloud\u0026rdquo; model: IDPs treated as Gaussian-distributed monomer clouds. Small crowders penetrate the cloud easily with minimal perturbation. Larger crowders cannot penetrate without steric clashes, leading to IDP compaction. Two regimes identified: Short chain regime: IDP compaction due to loss of free volume as crowders enter the chain\u0026rsquo;s exploration space. Long chain regime: At high concentrations, crowders overlap, influencing IDPs via polymer-polymer interpenetration effects. 4. Experiments and Controls Different PEG sizes used to systematically study crowder size effects. Crowder-induced compaction is observed regardless of IDP type, though extent varies. Salt and denaturant additions do not prevent compaction, indicating dominance of hard-core repulsion over weak nonspecific interactions. Tests with other polymers confirm general behavior, suggesting this is a robust polymeric effect, not specific to PEG. Hard-core repulsion and polymer physics, rather than specific chemical interactions, dominate IDP responses to crowding. 5. Broader Implications Standard models (like scaled-particle theory) are insufficient to explain IDP responses to crowding. The polymer nature of both IDPs and crowders must be accounted for in understanding cellular crowding effects. Excluded volume interactions and interpenetrability between flexible polymers emerge as key factors in cellular-like environments. Crowding may dynamically influence IDP-mediated signaling by modulating IDP size and accessibility. Important for understanding cellular regulation of IDP functions, including partner binding and phase separation. 6. RD\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts and Learnings Super interesting that crowder size, not just concentration, controls IDP compaction. Reinforces the idea that IDPs are not static coils but responsive polymers influenced by their surroundings. \u0026ldquo;Gaussian cloud\u0026rdquo; model offers a conceptually intuitive way to think about IDP-crowder interactions — love this model. Seeing IDPs as \u0026ldquo;soft polymers\u0026rdquo; rather than rigid bodies makes way more sense — fits into emerging views on IDP biophysics. Cool to see experimental work (FRET) combined with physical models to challenge prevailing ideas like scaled-particle theory. Potential to explore how PTMs might alter these crowding responses — e.g., phosphorylation could change how IDPs behave in dense environments. Take-home Messages IDP conformations are highly sensitive to molecular crowding, responding to both crowder size and concentration. Compaction increases with crowder size, a finding that challenges classic hard-sphere-based models. The \u0026ldquo;Gaussian cloud\u0026rdquo; model explains why larger crowders compact IDPs more strongly — penetration probability drops with size. Polymer-specific effects, including interpenetrability and excluded volume, are essential to understanding IDP behavior in cells. These insights reshape our understanding of IDP dynamics in crowded environments — essential for grasping how IDPs work in real cells. RD finds the Gaussian cloud model super inspiring — finally, a polymer physics view that makes sense for IDPs!✨\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/en/posts/mind/mindscape/82/","summary":"Notes on the 2014 PNAS paper using single-molecule FRET to analyze the conformational response of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to molecular crowding.

Investigated four representative IDPs: Prothymosin-α N-terminal and C-terminal segments (ProTα-N, ProTα-C) — highly charged, remain unfolded. ACTR — binding domain of thyroid hormone/retinoid receptor activator, IDP that folds upon partner binding. IN (HIV-1 integrase N-terminal domain) — folds upon ligand binding. 3. Core Findings and Insights Increasing crowder concentration leads to IDP compaction, observable as reduced Rg via FRET. Larger crowders cause more compaction than smaller ones, at odds with scaled-particle theory, which predicts larger crowders should create larger interstitial spaces. IDPs collapse more with increasing size of the crowders — a surprising and key observation challenging classical models. Introduction of \u0026ldquo;Gaussian cloud\u0026rdquo; model: IDPs treated as Gaussian-distributed monomer clouds. Small crowders penetrate the cloud easily with minimal perturbation. Larger crowders cannot penetrate without steric clashes, leading to IDP compaction. Two regimes identified: Short chain regime: IDP compaction due to loss of free volume as crowders enter the chain\u0026rsquo;s exploration space. Long chain regime: At high concentrations, crowders overlap, influencing IDPs via polymer-polymer interpenetration effects. 4. Experiments and Controls Different PEG sizes used to systematically study crowder size effects. Crowder-induced compaction is observed regardless of IDP type, though extent varies. Salt and denaturant additions do not prevent compaction, indicating dominance of hard-core repulsion over weak nonspecific interactions. Tests with other polymers confirm general behavior, suggesting this is a robust polymeric effect, not specific to PEG. Hard-core repulsion and polymer physics, rather than specific chemical interactions, dominate IDP responses to crowding. 5. Broader Implications Standard models (like scaled-particle theory) are insufficient to explain IDP responses to crowding. The polymer nature of both IDPs and crowders must be accounted for in understanding cellular crowding effects. Excluded volume interactions and interpenetrability between flexible polymers emerge as key factors in cellular-like environments. Crowding may dynamically influence IDP-mediated signaling by modulating IDP size and accessibility. Important for understanding cellular regulation of IDP functions, including partner binding and phase separation. 6. RD\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts and Learnings Super interesting that crowder size, not just concentration, controls IDP compaction. Reinforces the idea that IDPs are not static coils but responsive polymers influenced by their surroundings. \u0026ldquo;Gaussian cloud\u0026rdquo; model offers a conceptually intuitive way to think about IDP-crowder interactions — love this model. Seeing IDPs as \u0026ldquo;soft polymers\u0026rdquo; rather than rigid bodies makes way more sense — fits into emerging views on IDP biophysics. Cool to see experimental work (FRET) combined with physical models to challenge prevailing ideas like scaled-particle theory. Potential to explore how PTMs might alter these crowding responses — e.g., phosphorylation could change how IDPs behave in dense environments. Take-home Messages IDP conformations are highly sensitive to molecular crowding, responding to both crowder size and concentration. Compaction increases with crowder size, a finding that challenges classic hard-sphere-based models. The \u0026ldquo;Gaussian cloud\u0026rdquo; model explains why larger crowders compact IDPs more strongly — penetration probability drops with size. Polymer-specific effects, including interpenetrability and excluded volume, are essential to understanding IDP behavior in cells. These insights reshape our understanding of IDP dynamics in crowded environments — essential for grasping how IDPs work in real cells. RD finds the Gaussian cloud model super inspiring — finally, a polymer physics view that makes sense for IDPs!✨\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/zh/posts_zh/%E7%95%8C%E9%99%90%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%96/82/","summary":"Notes on the 2014 PNAS paper using single-molecule FRET to analyze the conformational response of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to molecular crowding.

With over 500 kinases in humans, selective targeting of substrates is essential for proper signaling. Although kinases share a conserved catalytic domain, they achieve unique substrate specificity through diverse mechanisms.\nThis review summarizes recent advances in understanding how kinases select substrates, exploring recognition motifs, docking interactions, scaffold recruitment, and multisite phosphorylation. These processes ensure that kinases phosphorylate specific sites while avoiding off-target residues, shaping cellular responses to internal and external signals.\nNotes 1. General Summary Protein kinases share highly conserved catalytic domains, but differ in regulation and substrate repertoire. Selective phosphorylation is crucial to avoid signaling errors — each kinase targets specific sites among vast proteomic options. Substrate selection involves multiple layers: motif recognition, docking, scaffolds, structural context, and multisite phosphorylation. 2. Mechanisms of Kinase Substrate Specificity A. Recognition Motifs Kinase recognition motifs are short linear sequences (1–3 residues) near phosphorylation sites, but widely distributed across the proteome. Specificity often relies on motif variants, guiding kinases toward correct substrates. \u0026ldquo;Forbidden\u0026rdquo; residues may act as negative selectors to prevent off-target phosphorylation. Example: ZAP70, a tyrosine kinase, prefers acidic residues and avoids basic residues, acting as an electrostatic filter. Motif recognition is necessary but not sufficient for high fidelity — additional interactions are critical. B. Docking Interactions (Direct) Docking motifs interact with non-catalytic surfaces of kinases, enhancing specificity and affinity. Example: MAPKs use DEF motifs (hydrophobic pocket near active site) and D-sites (C-lobe groove). Docking interactions allow for processive phosphorylation of multiple sites. Selective kinases, like GRKs (targeting GPCRs), use large interfaces for stringent specificity, coupling substrate binding with activation. C. Adaptor and Scaffold Proteins (Indirect) Adaptors bind both kinase and substrate, recruiting them into proximity. Scaffolds organize kinases, substrates, and regulators into signaling hubs. Example: MAPK cascades rely on scaffolds to connect upstream and downstream kinases. Scaffolds also control localization and conformationally prime substrates. D. Structural and Contextual Effects Phosphorylation sites often reside in flexible/disordered regions, but secondary/tertiary structure can influence kinase recognition. PKC isozymes recognize substrates based on \u0026ldquo;structural consensus\u0026rdquo;, selecting residues according to their folded conformation. Highlights the complexity of substrate selection beyond linear motifs — 3D context matters. 3. Multisite Phosphorylation: Integration, Amplification, and Control Hierarchical phosphorylation (prime-dependent) regulates signal integration and pathway crosstalk. Example: GSK3β requires prior phosphorylation (priming) for substrate recognition. Multisite phosphorylation allows fine-tuned responses, integrating multiple signals. EGFR prefers a pTyr at +1 to integrate with Src-mediated signaling via SHC. Prime-dependent sites create binding motifs for SH2, polobox domains, and adaptors like Cks1, MOB1, facilitating downstream signaling. Nonprocessive multisite phosphorylation can lead to switch-like behaviors, regulating signal strength and duration. Example: Elk-1 phosphorylation by ERK shows variable rates at different sites, shaping transcriptional outcomes. 4. Differential Substrate Quality and Functional Consequences Substrates vary in recognition quality, influencing phosphorylation efficiency and inhibitor sensitivity. mTOR complexes (mTORC1 vs. mTORC2) show distinct substrate preferences based on adaptor interactions. High- vs. low-quality sites explain differential inhibitor sensitivity (e.g., rapamycin affects low-quality sites). CDKs adjust specificity via cyclin partners to regulate cell cycle: Early-phase cyclins target high-affinity motifs. Late-phase substrates require higher CDK activity. Substrate quality shapes temporal and functional outputs of kinase signaling — a crucial aspect for therapeutic targeting. RD\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts and Learnings Still can\u0026rsquo;t love this paper, but its organization of substrate specificity mechanisms is solid. Like the candid line: \u0026ldquo;it is self-evident that the phosphorylated amino acid residue must interact at least transiently with the active site of the kinase.\u0026rdquo; — so true and rarely stated so clearly! The distinction between motif recognition, docking, and scaffold-based recruitment is important for understanding kinase complexity. Fascinated by structural consensus models (PKC) — residue selection based on folded substrate structure rather than linear motif is game-changing. Like the figure idea — connecting all mechanisms into a unified targeting model. Protein-modifying enzymes like kinases and ligases form a conceptual class — useful framework. Thinking about phosphorylation like \u0026ldquo;modification rules\u0026rdquo; imposed by both sequence and structure is powerful — could help in studying complex post-translational codes. Take-home Messages Kinase substrate targeting involves multiple integrated mechanisms: Recognition motifs, Docking outside catalytic cleft, Adaptor and scaffold-mediated recruitment, Structural/3D context, Multisite phosphorylation for integration and control. Substrate specificity regulates pathway fidelity, preventing erroneous phosphorylation in dense signaling networks. Multisite phosphorylation allows dynamic regulation and signal amplification/attenuation. Substrate quality impacts response sensitivity and inhibitor effects — relevant for targeted therapies.

EGFR prefers a pTyr at +1 to integrate with Src-mediated signaling via SHC. Prime-dependent sites create binding motifs for SH2, polobox domains, and adaptors like Cks1, MOB1, facilitating downstream signaling. Nonprocessive multisite phosphorylation can lead to switch-like behaviors, regulating signal strength and duration. Example: Elk-1 phosphorylation by ERK shows variable rates at different sites, shaping transcriptional outcomes. 4. Differential Substrate Quality and Functional Consequences Substrates vary in recognition quality, influencing phosphorylation efficiency and inhibitor sensitivity. mTOR complexes (mTORC1 vs. mTORC2) show distinct substrate preferences based on adaptor interactions. High- vs. low-quality sites explain differential inhibitor sensitivity (e.g., rapamycin affects low-quality sites). CDKs adjust specificity via cyclin partners to regulate cell cycle: Early-phase cyclins target high-affinity motifs. Late-phase substrates require higher CDK activity. Substrate quality shapes temporal and functional outputs of kinase signaling — a crucial aspect for therapeutic targeting. RD\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts and Learnings Still can\u0026rsquo;t love this paper, but its organization of substrate specificity mechanisms is solid. Like the candid line: \u0026ldquo;it is self-evident that the phosphorylated amino acid residue must interact at least transiently with the active site of the kinase.\u0026rdquo; — so true and rarely stated so clearly! The distinction between motif recognition, docking, and scaffold-based recruitment is important for understanding kinase complexity. Fascinated by structural consensus models (PKC) — residue selection based on folded substrate structure rather than linear motif is game-changing. Like the figure idea — connecting all mechanisms into a unified targeting model. Protein-modifying enzymes like kinases and ligases form a conceptual class — useful framework. Thinking about phosphorylation like \u0026ldquo;modification rules\u0026rdquo; imposed by both sequence and structure is powerful — could help in studying complex post-translational codes. Take-home Messages Kinase substrate targeting involves multiple integrated mechanisms: Recognition motifs, Docking outside catalytic cleft, Adaptor and scaffold-mediated recruitment, Structural/3D context, Multisite phosphorylation for integration and control. Substrate specificity regulates pathway fidelity, preventing erroneous phosphorylation in dense signaling networks. Multisite phosphorylation allows dynamic regulation and signal amplification/attenuation. Substrate quality impacts response sensitivity and inhibitor effects — relevant for targeted therapies. Although common kinase motifs are shared, layers of control ensure precise signaling outcomes — an elegant but complex system. RD still doesn\u0026rsquo;t love this paper, but respects its contribution to clarifying how kinases achieve specificity in the signaling maze. Figure: a pic from the paper for clarifying.

General Summary Helical Lattice Superposition Model unrolls helices onto a plane to analyze packing. Study investigates the mathematical relationship among helix radius (R), twist angle (ω), and rise per residue (Δ) for optimal packing. Three distinct interhelical packing angles are mathematically derived, corresponding to different helix types and radii. Observed α-helix parameters (ω = 99.1°, Δ = 1.45 Å) yield three packing angles: −37.1°, −97.4°, +22.0°. Near a twist angle ωₜᵣᵢₚₗₑ = 96.9°, all three packing angles converge to a common radius Rₜᵣᵢₚₗₑ = 3.46 Å, close to poly(Ala) helix radius, indicating alanine’s unique role in flexible packing. Suboptimal packing types, such as \u0026ldquo;knobs into holes,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;knobs onto knobs,\u0026rdquo; and mixed modes, explain associations stabilized by hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, disulfide bonds, and hydrophobic contacts. Experimental observations validate many predictions but also reveal deviations from model periodicity (180°) due to side-chain vector orientations. 2. Preknowledge and Background Dihedral angle: geometric angle describing helix-helix orientation. Crick (1953): Proposed \u0026ldquo;knobs into holes\u0026rdquo; model, suggesting +20° dihedral packing angle for coiled-coils based on optimal fitting of side chains. Richmond \u0026amp; Richards (1978): Suggested inverse relationship between packing angle and helix radius. Identified three packing classes based on amino acid preferences. Chothia et al. (1977): \u0026ldquo;Ridges into grooves\u0026rdquo; model, matching sequential residues (spacing i, j) between helices. Identified packing angles, notably −52° (i=4, j=4). Efimov (1979): Related packing angles to rotamer preferences of side-chains, distinguishing polar/apolar types. Reddy \u0026amp; Blundell (1993): Correlated interhelical distances with amino acid interface volume. Other studies explored energetic aspects, e.g., hydrophobic burial and atomic energy minimization. 3. Core Findings and Insights Mathematical framework yields three optimal packing angles per helix set, dependent on helix geometry. Flexibility near alanine-rich helices: At ωₜᵣᵢₚₗₑ = 96.9°, radius convergence (R = 3.46 Å) highlights alanine’s core-packing propensity. Experimental packings agree with model but show deviations explained by Cα–Cβ side-chain vector orientation, affecting real protein structures. Three main packing angles for α-helix with typical geometry: −37.1°, −97.4°, +22.0°, with 180° periodicity. \u0026ldquo;Knobs into holes\u0026rdquo; scheme favored over \u0026ldquo;ridges into grooves\u0026rdquo;, although both contribute to diverse packing types. Suboptimal and alternative packing patterns (hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, mixed types) enable diverse helix associations. Analysis provides insight into why i=4 (−52°) is optimal in Chothia\u0026rsquo;s model: relates to easier and more stable packing of side chains, possibly the most compatible angular offset for hydrophobic core formation. 4. RD\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts and Learnings RD finds this paper mathematically challenging — a reread (and maybe revisiting Crick\u0026rsquo;s 1953 paper first) is needed to fully digest the lattice model math. The concept of superposing helical lattices to derive packing angles is conceptually beautiful and rigorous. Fascinated by the convergence of radii at ωₜᵣᵢₚₗₑ = 96.9° and its alignment with poly(Ala) properties — explains alanine\u0026rsquo;s dominance in core packing. Great synergy between mathematical prediction and experimental confirmation — even discrepancies lead to deeper insights (Cα–Cβ vectors). The comparison of \u0026ldquo;knobs into holes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;ridges into grooves\u0026rdquo; provides a framework for thinking about side-chain interactions, applicable beyond helices (e.g., β-sheet interfaces, coiled-coils). Potential application to residue interaction networks (RINs): could similar geometric packing principles explain network connectivity? RD wonders if these packing angles correlate with phosphorylation-dependent structural rearrangements (e.g., helix reorientation upon PTMs). Take-home Messages Helix-helix packing in proteins can be mathematically modeled using helical lattice superposition, revealing three key packing angles and corresponding radii. Alanine plays a crucial role in flexible core formation due to ideal radius (≈3.46 Å) at converging twist angles. \u0026ldquo;Knobs into holes\u0026rdquo; remains a dominant model, but mixed and alternative packing stabilize diverse associations. Deviations from theory explained by side-chain geometry (Cα–Cβ orientation), emphasizing chemistry + geometry synergy.

General Summary Helical Lattice Superposition Model unrolls helices onto a plane to analyze packing. Study investigates the mathematical relationship among helix radius (R), twist angle (ω), and rise per residue (Δ) for optimal packing. Three distinct interhelical packing angles are mathematically derived, corresponding to different helix types and radii. Observed α-helix parameters (ω = 99.1°, Δ = 1.45 Å) yield three packing angles: −37.1°, −97.4°, +22.0°. Near a twist angle ωₜᵣᵢₚₗₑ = 96.9°, all three packing angles converge to a common radius Rₜᵣᵢₚₗₑ = 3.46 Å, close to poly(Ala) helix radius, indicating alanine’s unique role in flexible packing. Suboptimal packing types, such as \u0026ldquo;knobs into holes,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;knobs onto knobs,\u0026rdquo; and mixed modes, explain associations stabilized by hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, disulfide bonds, and hydrophobic contacts. Experimental observations validate many predictions but also reveal deviations from model periodicity (180°) due to side-chain vector orientations. 2. Preknowledge and Background Dihedral angle: geometric angle describing helix-helix orientation. Crick (1953): Proposed \u0026ldquo;knobs into holes\u0026rdquo; model, suggesting +20° dihedral packing angle for coiled-coils based on optimal fitting of side chains. Richmond \u0026amp; Richards (1978): Suggested inverse relationship between packing angle and helix radius. Identified three packing classes based on amino acid preferences. Chothia et al. (1977): \u0026ldquo;Ridges into grooves\u0026rdquo; model, matching sequential residues (spacing i, j) between helices. Identified packing angles, notably −52° (i=4, j=4). Efimov (1979): Related packing angles to rotamer preferences of side-chains, distinguishing polar/apolar types. Reddy \u0026amp; Blundell (1993): Correlated interhelical distances with amino acid interface volume. Other studies explored energetic aspects, e.g., hydrophobic burial and atomic energy minimization. 3. Core Findings and Insights Mathematical framework yields three optimal packing angles per helix set, dependent on helix geometry. Flexibility near alanine-rich helices: At ωₜᵣᵢₚₗₑ = 96.9°, radius convergence (R = 3.46 Å) highlights alanine’s core-packing propensity. Experimental packings agree with model but show deviations explained by Cα–Cβ side-chain vector orientation, affecting real protein structures. Three main packing angles for α-helix with typical geometry: −37.1°, −97.4°, +22.0°, with 180° periodicity. \u0026ldquo;Knobs into holes\u0026rdquo; scheme favored over \u0026ldquo;ridges into grooves\u0026rdquo;, although both contribute to diverse packing types. Suboptimal and alternative packing patterns (hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, mixed types) enable diverse helix associations. Analysis provides insight into why i=4 (−52°) is optimal in Chothia\u0026rsquo;s model: relates to easier and more stable packing of side chains, possibly the most compatible angular offset for hydrophobic core formation. 4. RD\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts and Learnings RD finds this paper mathematically challenging — a reread (and maybe revisiting Crick\u0026rsquo;s 1953 paper first) is needed to fully digest the lattice model math. The concept of superposing helical lattices to derive packing angles is conceptually beautiful and rigorous. Fascinated by the convergence of radii at ωₜᵣᵢₚₗₑ = 96.9° and its alignment with poly(Ala) properties — explains alanine\u0026rsquo;s dominance in core packing. Great synergy between mathematical prediction and experimental confirmation — even discrepancies lead to deeper insights (Cα–Cβ vectors). The comparison of \u0026ldquo;knobs into holes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;ridges into grooves\u0026rdquo; provides a framework for thinking about side-chain interactions, applicable beyond helices (e.g., β-sheet interfaces, coiled-coils). Potential application to residue interaction networks (RINs): could similar geometric packing principles explain network connectivity? RD wonders if these packing angles correlate with phosphorylation-dependent structural rearrangements (e.g., helix reorientation upon PTMs). Take-home Messages Helix-helix packing in proteins can be mathematically modeled using helical lattice superposition, revealing three key packing angles and corresponding radii. Alanine plays a crucial role in flexible core formation due to ideal radius (≈3.46 Å) at converging twist angles. \u0026ldquo;Knobs into holes\u0026rdquo; remains a dominant model, but mixed and alternative packing stabilize diverse associations. Deviations from theory explained by side-chain geometry (Cα–Cβ orientation), emphasizing chemistry + geometry synergy. Provides a powerful design principle for protein engineering, predicting optimal helix-helix associations.

This review elegantly dissects the structure-function relationships that underlie CaMKII\u0026rsquo;s diverse roles, highlighting autoinhibition, autophosphorylation, isoform targeting, and self-association as key regulatory features. Notes 1. CaMKII Isoform Diversity and Structure Four genes (α, β, γ, δ) with ~30 spliced isoforms, varying by alternative splicing in variable linker and targeting domains. Brain-specific α and β isoforms are dominant (up to 2% of total protein); α isoform concentration in forebrain: 19–37 μM. High sequence similarity (~89–93%) in catalytic/autoregulatory domains across isoforms. Some isoforms (e.g., αB) contain NLS, enabling nuclear targeting regulated by phosphorylation. βM isoform contains multiple targeting domains, supporting subcellular specificity. Key idea: Isoform diversity enables cellular compartmentalization, fine-tuning CaMKII function via specific localization and interaction partners.\n2. Autoinhibition and Activation by Ca2+/CaM Autoinhibitory domain (residues 281–317) contains pseudosubstrate elements and CaM-binding sequence. Inhibitory mechanism: autoinhibitory domain blocks catalytic site via pseudosubstrate mimicry and interference with ATP binding (e.g., His282 may mimic ATP). Ca2+/CaM binding displaces autoinhibitory segment, releasing active site and enabling substrate phosphorylation. CaMKII activation is fully CaM-dependent, unlike CaMKI/IV, which require phosphorylation by upstream CaMKK for full activation. Important: CaMKII does NOT require phosphorylation for activation, but autophosphorylation (e.g., Thr286) provides autonomous activity and CaM trapping.\n3. Autophosphorylation and Autonomous Activity Thr286 phosphorylation creates Ca2+/CaM-independent activity (molecular memory). AutoP of Thr286 enhances CaM binding by exposing residues 293–295. Thr305/306 phosphorylation prevents CaM binding — key for resetting kinase. Autophosphorylation on Thr306 occurs in basal/inactive state and may block subsequent Ca2+/CaM binding. Switch-like behavior: Once phosphorylated at Thr286, CaMKII remains active, integrating past Ca2+ events, thus serving as a cellular register.\n4. Holoenzyme Structure and Self-association Holoenzyme = dodecamer (12-mer) of subunits arranged around a hub domain; requires residues 344–478 for assembly. Self-association into larger aggregates occurs in vitro and in neurons, regulated by isoform composition and biochemical conditions (pH, ATP). α or α/β holoenzymes self-associate robustly; β-only holoenzymes do not. Self-association may limit activation, contribute to targeting, or regulate subunit exchange. Note: \u0026ldquo;Pseudoanchor\u0026rdquo; sequences may serve as latent targeting motifs, exposed only upon activation.\n5. Frequency Detection and Molecular Mechanisms Autonomous activity generation and response to Ca2+ spike frequency depend on inter- and intra-holoenzyme autophosphorylation. Frequency detection models: Interval detection: rate of dephosphorylation vs. stimulation interval. Sequential autophosphorylation of specific sites as a rate-limiting step. Linker length and isoform-specific properties modulate CaMKII\u0026rsquo;s response to Ca2+ signals. Summary: CaMKII functions as a molecular integrator of calcium signals, sensitive to the timing and frequency of Ca2+ oscillations.\n6. ATP and CaM Cross-talk in Activation ATP binding enhances CaM affinity: Kd for CaM: 150 pM (with ATP), 2 μM (without ATP). ATP stabilizes CaM-CaMKII interaction, promoting activation. Reciprocal effect: CaM binding facilitates ATP interaction, cooperativity in activation process. 7. RD’s Reflections Foundational paper for understanding CaMKII structure-function — a must reread!

Occurs both in cis (intramolecular) and in trans (intermolecular), often following regulatory ligand binding. Influences substrate affinity, enzyme stability, and downstream signal specificity. Key Points 1. PKA (cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase) Exists as a tetramer (R2C2); R = regulatory subunit, C = catalytic subunit. Autophosphorylation of RII subunits (Ser-95/Ser-112) reduces affinity for C, facilitating activation upon cAMP binding. C subunit autophosphorylation sites: Thr-197 (near active site, essential for high substrate affinity, enhances activity). Ser-338, Ser-10 (possible modulatory roles). R autophosphorylation inhibits PP-1, possibly prolonging PKA effects. 2. Phosphorylase Kinase First kinase identified with autophosphorylation capacity. Subunit composition: α, β, γ, δ; δ = calmodulin. Autophosphorylation of α and β subunits enhances activity. Requires Ca²⁺, and troponin C can stimulate it. Physiological significance remains unclear. 3. MLCK (Myosin Light Chain Kinase) Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation at Ser-160, Ser-234. Does not affect kinetics but increases sensitivity to inhibition by phosphorylated MLC. Amino-terminal region likely influences substrate interaction. 4. PKC (Protein Kinase C) Autophosphorylation at multiple sites (Ser-16, Thr-17, Thr-314, Thr-324, Thr-634, Thr-641) enhances activity. Increases phorbol ester affinity, reduces Ca²⁺ sensitivity. Influences substrate specificity, regulation, and downregulation. 5. Mos (MAPK Pathway Regulator) Autophosphorylation critical during GVBD (germinal vesicle breakdown). Stabilizes Mos for metaphase II arrest, prevents ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Possibly initiated by another kinase but sustained via autoP (esp. Ser-3). 6. Rhodopsin Kinase (RK/GRK1) Phosphorylates photoactivated rhodopsin (Rho)*. Autophosphorylation at Ser-488, Thr-489: Decreases affinity for phosphorylated Rho*. Facilitates enzyme-substrate complex dissociation via electrostatic repulsion. 7. Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) Example: Insulin Receptor (IR): Autophosphorylation of Tyr-1146, Tyr-1150, Tyr-1151 enhances kinase activity. Enables insulin-independent activity. Tyr-1316, Tyr-1322 act as negative regulators. RTKs cluster into 3 groups: EGFR, IR (tetrameric), PDGFR. 8. Src Family Kinases Positive regulation: AutoP near catalytic site enhances activity. Negative regulation: AutoP in C-terminal tail inhibits activity. Family members: c-Src, c-Yes, Fyn, c-Fgr, Lck, Hck, Lyn, Blk. Functional Effects of Autophosphorylation Catalytic activity enhancement. Altered sensitivity or specificity for allosteric effectors. Protection or targeting for proteolysis. Membrane association modulation. Endocytosis regulation. Mediating protein-protein interactions. \u0026ldquo;Autophosphorylation impacts virtually all aspects of kinase function.\u0026quot;\nEvolutionary Perspectives Two models: Autophosphorylation domains evolved from unrelated phosphorylation sites (possibly as competitive inhibitors). Post-fusion evolution: Autophosphorylation sites evolved after regulatory and catalytic domains combined, allowing opportunistic regulation. The diversity of autoP sites suggests second pathway is more likely. Discussion Highlights Common themes: Triggered by regulatory ligands. Multiple sites phosphorylated, often following kinase domain specificity. Enhances ligand and substrate affinity, prolonging activation. Tissue-specific variations modulated by phosphatases. Philosophical thought: “It is an error in logic to assume that autophosphorylation has relevance in all instances, but equally flawed to dismiss its importance where functional effects are yet unobserved.” AutoP as a unifying and flexible mechanism of kinase regulation—context-dependent, tissue-dependent, dynamic. Future Questions How do specific autoP patterns affect cell-specific signaling and disease states? Can engineered autoP sites be used to modulate kinase behavior for therapeutic purposes? How does autophosphorylation crosstalk with other PTMs (e.g., ubiquitination, acetylation)? RD\u0026rsquo;s Takeaways Love the breadth of autoP effects—from enzyme activity to degradation control!

Occurs both in cis (intramolecular) and in trans (intermolecular), often following regulatory ligand binding. Influences substrate affinity, enzyme stability, and downstream signal specificity. Key Points 1. PKA (cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase) Exists as a tetramer (R2C2); R = regulatory subunit, C = catalytic subunit. Autophosphorylation of RII subunits (Ser-95/Ser-112) reduces affinity for C, facilitating activation upon cAMP binding. C subunit autophosphorylation sites: Thr-197 (near active site, essential for high substrate affinity, enhances activity). Ser-338, Ser-10 (possible modulatory roles). R autophosphorylation inhibits PP-1, possibly prolonging PKA effects. 2. Phosphorylase Kinase First kinase identified with autophosphorylation capacity. Subunit composition: α, β, γ, δ; δ = calmodulin. Autophosphorylation of α and β subunits enhances activity. Requires Ca²⁺, and troponin C can stimulate it. Physiological significance remains unclear. 3. MLCK (Myosin Light Chain Kinase) Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation at Ser-160, Ser-234. Does not affect kinetics but increases sensitivity to inhibition by phosphorylated MLC. Amino-terminal region likely influences substrate interaction. 4. PKC (Protein Kinase C) Autophosphorylation at multiple sites (Ser-16, Thr-17, Thr-314, Thr-324, Thr-634, Thr-641) enhances activity. Increases phorbol ester affinity, reduces Ca²⁺ sensitivity. Influences substrate specificity, regulation, and downregulation. 5. Mos (MAPK Pathway Regulator) Autophosphorylation critical during GVBD (germinal vesicle breakdown). Stabilizes Mos for metaphase II arrest, prevents ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Possibly initiated by another kinase but sustained via autoP (esp. Ser-3). 6. Rhodopsin Kinase (RK/GRK1) Phosphorylates photoactivated rhodopsin (Rho)*. Autophosphorylation at Ser-488, Thr-489: Decreases affinity for phosphorylated Rho*. Facilitates enzyme-substrate complex dissociation via electrostatic repulsion. 7. Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) Example: Insulin Receptor (IR): Autophosphorylation of Tyr-1146, Tyr-1150, Tyr-1151 enhances kinase activity. Enables insulin-independent activity. Tyr-1316, Tyr-1322 act as negative regulators. RTKs cluster into 3 groups: EGFR, IR (tetrameric), PDGFR. 8. Src Family Kinases Positive regulation: AutoP near catalytic site enhances activity. Negative regulation: AutoP in C-terminal tail inhibits activity. Family members: c-Src, c-Yes, Fyn, c-Fgr, Lck, Hck, Lyn, Blk. Functional Effects of Autophosphorylation Catalytic activity enhancement. Altered sensitivity or specificity for allosteric effectors. Protection or targeting for proteolysis. Membrane association modulation. Endocytosis regulation. Mediating protein-protein interactions. \u0026ldquo;Autophosphorylation impacts virtually all aspects of kinase function.\u0026quot;\nEvolutionary Perspectives Two models: Autophosphorylation domains evolved from unrelated phosphorylation sites (possibly as competitive inhibitors). Post-fusion evolution: Autophosphorylation sites evolved after regulatory and catalytic domains combined, allowing opportunistic regulation. The diversity of autoP sites suggests second pathway is more likely. Discussion Highlights Common themes: Triggered by regulatory ligands. Multiple sites phosphorylated, often following kinase domain specificity. Enhances ligand and substrate affinity, prolonging activation. Tissue-specific variations modulated by phosphatases. Philosophical thought: “It is an error in logic to assume that autophosphorylation has relevance in all instances, but equally flawed to dismiss its importance where functional effects are yet unobserved.” AutoP as a unifying and flexible mechanism of kinase regulation—context-dependent, tissue-dependent, dynamic. Future Questions How do specific autoP patterns affect cell-specific signaling and disease states? Can engineered autoP sites be used to modulate kinase behavior for therapeutic purposes? How does autophosphorylation crosstalk with other PTMs (e.g., ubiquitination, acetylation)? RD\u0026rsquo;s Takeaways Love the breadth of autoP effects—from enzyme activity to degradation control! The dual role in activating and inhibiting kinases (e.g., Src) is fascinating—context matters! Insightful for kinase signaling pathway models—adds complexity beyond linear cascades.

The results strongly support a monophyletic origin of plant and protist CDPKs along with CDPK-related kinases (CRKs) and provide intriguing insights into how ancient intron-mediated gene fusion may have shaped the emergence of CDPKs.

Conserved introns mirror phylogenetic trees, supporting evolutionary relatedness. Intron position analysis can serve as an independent line of evidence for evolutionary relationships, beyond sequence similarity.\n3. Ancestral Gene Fusion Hypothesis for CDPK Evolution The presence of a phase zero intron at the start of CaM-LD (shared with animal/fungal CaM genes) suggests that CDPK originated from a recombination between a kinase gene and a CaM gene. No CDPK-like fusions found in animals or fungi, and no CaMK-like genes in plants. Likely, CDPK represents a unique evolutionary innovation in plants and protists. Ancient exon shuffling via introns may have produced the unique multi-domain architecture of CDPKs.\n4. Evolutionary Diversification Reflected in Domain Conservation Kinase domain (KD) is the most conserved (52% similarity). Junction domain (JD): ~42% similarity. CaM-like domain (CaM-LD): ~36% similarity. N-terminal regions are highly variable—likely connected to substrate specificity and localization. Pattern of conservation suggests core kinase activity is preserved, while regulation and substrate recognition are diversified.\n5. Introns as Evolutionary Markers Introns shared across plants and protists precede their divergence, marking an ancient common ancestor. Intron loss and gain observed: Likely through reverse transcription and reintegration (intron loss). De novo insertion (intron gain). Combination of ancient and new introns, supporting both introns-early and introns-late theories. CDPKs embody a rich evolutionary history of intron dynamics, reflecting both deep ancestry and lineage-specific changes.\n6. Shared Evolutionary Relationship with PEPCK? Plant phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinases (PEPCKs) have kinase domains similar to CDPKs but lack JD and CaM-LD.

The crystal structure of cyclinA-CDK2-ATP complex at 2.3 Å resolution elucidates how cyclin binding primes CDK2 for catalysis.\nPre-knowledge CDKs regulate cell cycle progression, requiring cyclin binding and CDK-activating kinase (CAK) phosphorylation for full activation. Cyclin binding defines substrate specificity and timing of activation. CDKs share conserved kinase folds, but their activation mechanisms involve cyclin-induced conformational changes. CDKs differ from PKA, which is regulated by inhibitory subunit binding rather than activating partners. Experimental Highlights Limited proteolysis identified a 29 kDa core of cyclinA (173–432), capable of binding and activating CDK2. Crystallization produced a hexagonal form refined to 2.3 Å, containing two molecules each of CDK2, cyclinA, ATP, and waters. Key Structural and Mechanistic Findings 1. CDK2 Structural Rearrangement upon CyclinA Binding CDK2 contains an N-terminal β-sheet lobe (1–85) and C-terminal α-helix lobe, with ATP binding in a deep cleft. CyclinA binds across both lobes, forming a large protein-protein interface (~3550 Å² buried area). Fancy idea: CyclinA binding reorganizes CDK2\u0026rsquo;s architecture, specifically the PSTAIRE helix and T-loop, to expose and assemble the active site.\n2. PSTAIRE Helix Dynamics and Active Site Realignment PSTAIRE helix rotation (~90°) and translation move E51 into the catalytic cleft, forming a critical salt bridge with K33 — necessary for ATP positioning and catalysis. In free CDK2, E51 is solvent-exposed, explaining its inactivity. The helix shift enables tight packing of hydrophobic residues (e.g., I35, V69, L76, L78) to stabilize active conformation. #Conformational engineering: PSTAIRE helix acts as a molecular switch controlled by cyclin binding to activate CDK2.\n3. T-loop Rearrangement and Catalytic Cleft Access T-loop melting (αL12 helix disruption) removes steric blockade at catalytic cleft, exposing Thr160 for phosphorylation by CAK. CyclinA causes T-loop to form a β-strand interaction with the C-lobe, stabilizing the open state. Unlike PKA (where equivalent residue is phosphorylated and stabilized), in cyclinA-bound CDK2, Thr160 remains unphosphorylated, implying partial activation until CAK acts. #T-loop as a regulatory gate: CyclinA primes but phosphorylation locks the active state.\n4. Cyclin Box Architecture in CyclinA CyclinA\u0026rsquo;s 12 α-helices include two consecutive domains (208–303 and 309–399) with highly similar folds despite low sequence identity (12%). The first repeat (cyclin box) directly interacts with CDK2’s PSTAIRE helix and T-loop, driving activation. 5. Molecular Interface and Key Residues Ala48, Ile52 in CDK2\u0026rsquo;s PSTAIRE helix become tightly packed in active complex. CyclinA induces repacking of hydrophobic residues like Leu54, Leu55, bringing them into new contacts critical for stabilization. Salt bridges and hydrogen bonds stabilize key interactions (e.g., Glu51-Lys33). #Precision interface design: Cyclin-induced repacking fine-tunes catalytic cleft assembly.\nConceptual Summary CyclinA binding to CDK2 is not just tethering — it reconstructs the catalytic machinery by moving key structural elements. PSTAIRE helix repositioning and T-loop refolding are central to CDK2 activation.

Conformational Changes in Kinases Global changes: Many kinases exhibit hinge-bending or domain rotation for active site closure and precise substrate positioning. E.g., adenylate kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase. Local shifts: Small adjustments like shear motion in E. coli phosphofructokinase. Glycine-rich loop in PKA flexibly interacts with ATP. Minimal changes: Some kinases (e.g., nucleoside diphosphate kinase) show little conformational adjustment upon substrate binding, reflecting diverse mechanistic strategies. Binding may induce changes or select pre-existing conformations, supporting conformational selection models. 2. Cofactor Roles: Mg²⁺ and Mn²⁺ Mg²⁺–nucleotide complex is essential for catalysis, coordinating β- and γ-phosphoryl groups and aligning substrates for transfer. Water molecules and protein oxygens complete Mg²⁺ coordination sphere, promoting a favorable geometry for phosphoryl transfer. In ADP/GDP-bound kinases, Mg²⁺ bridges β-phosphate and phosphorylated product, aiding catalysis. Some kinases require two divalent cations: E.g., pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase—Mg²⁺ for nucleotide binding, Mn²⁺ for catalysis. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase crystal structure shows Mn²⁺ bridging ATP and pyruvate, coordinating transition states and intermediates. 3. Binding Mechanisms: Motifs and Specific Interactions Nucleotide binding via P-loop (phosphate-binding loop): Conserved glycines allow close approach to phosphoryl groups. Ser/Thr residues coordinate Mg²⁺. Lysine stabilizes β- and γ-phosphates. Adenine binding: Less conserved, often via hydrophobic interactions or main-chain hydrogen bonds. Structural water may assist nucleotide stabilization. α-helix dipole may stabilize phosphoryl groups, enhancing transfer readiness. 4. Catalytic Mechanisms: Single vs. Double Displacement Single displacement (direct displacement): Ternary complex forms with both substrates bound before transfer. Double displacement (ping-pong): Formation of phospho-enzyme intermediate (e.g., via histidine) before transferring phosphate to acceptor. 5. Phosphoryl Transfer Mechanisms: SN1 vs. SN2 Associative (SN2-like): Direct nucleophilic attack, forming a pentacoordinate phosphorane (PO₄³⁻). Transition state with net charge ~−3. Short distances between phosphate and acceptor, promoting in-line attack. Dissociative (SN1-like): Phosphate leaves first, forming planar metaphosphate (PO₃⁻), net charge ~−1. Nucleophile attacks after phosphate group dissociates, stepwise bond formation. Conflicting evidence: UMP/CMP kinase supports associative mechanism (SN2-like). Nucleoside diphosphate kinase, H-Ras show mixed features, unclear dominant mechanism. 6. RD\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts and Takeaways The paper beautifully connects structural data to chemical mechanism, clarifying how kinases achieve efficient phosphate transfer. Conformational flexibility, cofactor orchestration, and precise binding motifs are all interdependent features enabling catalysis. The SN1 vs. SN2 debate in kinases is nuanced, and context- or kinase-dependent—important for RD’s own understanding of catalysis.

Key insight: CH1 secures the inactive conformation by interlocking with the KD, explaining why CDPKs are tightly controlled by CAD without requiring separate calmodulin.\n2. Unique Autoinhibition Mechanisms Distinct from CaMK CAD’s CH1 binds deeply into KD’s substrate site — unlike CaMKII’s flexible inhibition loop. Conserved KED triad in KD, engaged by CH1 Lys338, stabilizes inactive conformation. Insert in N-EF lobe of CAD (unique to some CDPKs, absent in CaM/TnC) helps lock KD in inactive form.

The hydrophobic anchors are Trp444 and Phe459, separated by 14 residues, making it the longest anchor distance reported for a CaM-binding motif.\nThis distinct recognition class may underlie specialized regulation of CaMKK and similar proteins, offering new perspectives on Ca2+-mediated signal transduction.\nNotes 1. Experimental Approach and Structural Overview High-resolution NMR structure of Ca2+/CaM bound to a CaMKK-derived peptide (residues 438–463). Comparison with previously known CaM-target complexes (MLCK, CaMKII). Dissection of hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts, and quantitative characterization of domain reorientation. A pioneering structural study that extends our understanding of CaM plasticity!\n2. Key Structural Insights A. Unique Peptide Folding and Binding CaMKK peptide forms two structural elements: N-terminal α-helix (usual feature in CaM-binding). C-terminal hairpin-like loop, stabilized by internal hydrophobic interactions (Met453, Phe459). Dual structure provides an extended interface, differing from compact α-helix-only motifs in MLCK and CaMKII. Dual α-helix + loop — a new mode of target engagement by CaM.\nB. Reverse Binding Orientation and Anchoring Opposite binding orientation compared to all known CaM complexes. Hydrophobic anchors: Trp444 (N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of CaM). Phe459 (C-terminal hydrophobic pocket of CaM). Anchor separation is 14 residues, compared to 8-12 residues in other targets — the longest spacing observed. Binding site covers an extended surface, clamped by both CaM domains. CaM clamps the extended peptide using a novel alignment — reverse and longer!\nC. Conformational Adaptation of CaM N- and C-terminal domains of CaM retain their structures, but the linker melts to allow target clamping. Extensive hydrophobic contacts dominate, supported by specific salt bridges and hydrogen bonds (e.g., E11-R349, E114-K334). The CaM channel formed involves asymmetric contributions from N and C domains, driven by distribution of charges on peptide. 3. Functional Implications of the CaMKK-CaM Complex CaM-binding domain of CaMKK overlaps with its autoinhibitory domain — binding of CaM relieves autoinhibition. Phosphorylation at Ser458 by PKA (within the binding motif) abolishes CaM binding, providing a regulatory switch. Binding mode suggests specialized regulation of CaMKK, different from MLCK/CaMKII: May explain why CaMKK acts as a Ca2+/CaM relay kinase, sitting upstream in the CaM cascade (activating CaMKI/IV). The \u0026ldquo;two-module\u0026rdquo; CaM relay system (CaMKK → CaMKI/IV) amplifies Ca2+ signals, possibly making the system more sensitive and responsive to subtle Ca2+ fluctuations. 4. RD’s Takeaways and Reflections LOVE the reversed binding — CaM is so flexible yet specific! This expands how we think of CaM-target interactions beyond simple helices. 14-residue spacing between anchors shows CaM can handle large motifs, challenging the idea that only short helices can engage CaM. The hairpin-like loop is a game-changer, introducing internal peptide folding as part of CaM recognition — could this be common in other \u0026ldquo;unusual\u0026rdquo; CaM targets? The melting linker of CaM underlines its plasticity — think about how this may modulate the strength and kinetics of binding. CaMKK as a unique CaM partner at the top of a cascade regulating other CaM-dependent kinases — a beautiful amplification logic in Ca2+ signaling. PKA phosphorylation at Ser458 as a switch — yet another layer of control embedded within the CaM-binding region — brilliant natural engineering!

The hydrophobic anchors are Trp444 and Phe459, separated by 14 residues, making it the longest anchor distance reported for a CaM-binding motif.\nThis distinct recognition class may underlie specialized regulation of CaMKK and similar proteins, offering new perspectives on Ca2+-mediated signal transduction.\nNotes 1. Experimental Approach and Structural Overview High-resolution NMR structure of Ca2+/CaM bound to a CaMKK-derived peptide (residues 438–463). Comparison with previously known CaM-target complexes (MLCK, CaMKII). Dissection of hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts, and quantitative characterization of domain reorientation. A pioneering structural study that extends our understanding of CaM plasticity!\n2. Key Structural Insights A. Unique Peptide Folding and Binding CaMKK peptide forms two structural elements: N-terminal α-helix (usual feature in CaM-binding). C-terminal hairpin-like loop, stabilized by internal hydrophobic interactions (Met453, Phe459). Dual structure provides an extended interface, differing from compact α-helix-only motifs in MLCK and CaMKII. Dual α-helix + loop — a new mode of target engagement by CaM.\nB. Reverse Binding Orientation and Anchoring Opposite binding orientation compared to all known CaM complexes. Hydrophobic anchors: Trp444 (N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of CaM). Phe459 (C-terminal hydrophobic pocket of CaM). Anchor separation is 14 residues, compared to 8-12 residues in other targets — the longest spacing observed. Binding site covers an extended surface, clamped by both CaM domains. CaM clamps the extended peptide using a novel alignment — reverse and longer!\nC. Conformational Adaptation of CaM N- and C-terminal domains of CaM retain their structures, but the linker melts to allow target clamping. Extensive hydrophobic contacts dominate, supported by specific salt bridges and hydrogen bonds (e.g., E11-R349, E114-K334). The CaM channel formed involves asymmetric contributions from N and C domains, driven by distribution of charges on peptide. 3. Functional Implications of the CaMKK-CaM Complex CaM-binding domain of CaMKK overlaps with its autoinhibitory domain — binding of CaM relieves autoinhibition. Phosphorylation at Ser458 by PKA (within the binding motif) abolishes CaM binding, providing a regulatory switch. Binding mode suggests specialized regulation of CaMKK, different from MLCK/CaMKII: May explain why CaMKK acts as a Ca2+/CaM relay kinase, sitting upstream in the CaM cascade (activating CaMKI/IV). The \u0026ldquo;two-module\u0026rdquo; CaM relay system (CaMKK → CaMKI/IV) amplifies Ca2+ signals, possibly making the system more sensitive and responsive to subtle Ca2+ fluctuations. 4. RD’s Takeaways and Reflections LOVE the reversed binding — CaM is so flexible yet specific! This expands how we think of CaM-target interactions beyond simple helices. 14-residue spacing between anchors shows CaM can handle large motifs, challenging the idea that only short helices can engage CaM. The hairpin-like loop is a game-changer, introducing internal peptide folding as part of CaM recognition — could this be common in other \u0026ldquo;unusual\u0026rdquo; CaM targets? The melting linker of CaM underlines its plasticity — think about how this may modulate the strength and kinetics of binding. CaMKK as a unique CaM partner at the top of a cascade regulating other CaM-dependent kinases — a beautiful amplification logic in Ca2+ signaling. PKA phosphorylation at Ser458 as a switch — yet another layer of control embedded within the CaM-binding region — brilliant natural engineering!

CaM is a master decoder of Ca2+ signals — this paper shows how its flexibility makes it a universal switch for cellular processes.\nTake-Home Messages CaM adapts its conformation to different target peptides, with N-lobe rotations ranging from 156° to 196° for precise binding. Hydrophobic cavities, especially Met side-chains, play a central role in peptide anchoring — dynamically adjusting to fit targets. Electrostatic interactions and specific hydrogen bonds determine peptide binding orientation and strength. Binding of CaM to target peptides, including CaMKK, relieves autoinhibition, enabling activation of kinase cascades in response to Ca2+. Calmodulin’s structural adaptability is key to its role as a versatile mediator of calcium signaling in eukaryotic cells.

General Implications for CDPK and Kinase Engineering Chimeric CDPKs demonstrate programmable kinase-substrate recognition, a strategy not fully explored in plants before. The 81% similarity of CDPK1 KD to CaMK suggests that adding a variable N-terminal domain to other kinases (e.g., mammalian) could tune substrate specificity. Possibility of extending N-terminal guided substrate recognition to other kinase families, beyond CDPKs.\n7. Interesting Functional Insight on RSG-CDPK1 Interaction The interaction between RSG and CDPK1 N-domain exposes S114 for phosphorylation. N-terminal domain increases local substrate concentration near the active site, boosting phosphorylation efficiency. ~3000-fold effective local concentration increase within a 10-nm radius from the kinase active site — biophysical underpinning of N-domain contribution. N-terminal domain acts like a \u0026ldquo;substrate trap\u0026rdquo;, focusing kinase activity onto specific targets.\n8. Broader Perspective on Substrate Specificity Substrate selection involves multi-layered mechanisms: Active site–substrate sequence compatibility. Docking motifs. Subcellular localization. Expression timing. Scaffold proteins. For CDPK, lacking scaffolds and targeting domains, N-terminal domain emerges as the key selector. CDPKs thus represent a model where substrate specificity is \u0026ldquo;hardwired\u0026rdquo; into the protein, offering insights for synthetic biology.\nFinal Thought \u0026ldquo;If we can swap N-terminal domains to rewire CDPK substrate specificity, could we extend this idea to reprogram other kinases, building synthetic signaling pathways tailored to specific needs?\u0026quot;\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/zh/posts_zh/%E7%95%8C%E9%99%90%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%96/55/","summary":"Note on the discovery that the variable N-terminal domain of CDPK1 controls substrate specificity—offering a new mechanism to engineer signaling specificity in plants.","title":"N-terminal Domain of CDPK1 Determines Substrate Specificity: A Key to Rewiring Kinase Signaling"},{"content":"Keywords EF-hand, Calcium binding, Parvalbumin, Myosin light chain, T4 lysozyme, Protein evolution, Helix-loop-helix, Ancestral motif\nReference DOI: 10.1126/science.1111094\nAbstract In this early computational study, EF-hand calcium-binding motifs, characteristic of proteins like parvalbumin, were predicted in proteins not previously associated with calcium binding, including rabbit myosin light chains and T4 lysozyme.

Experimental Approach: Development of CDPK-FRET Reporters Genetically encoded FRET biosensor (CPKaleon) created to detect Ca2+-dependent conformational changes in CDPKs. Focus on two functionally related but differentially sensitive CDPKs: AtCPK21: high Ca2+-sensitivity. AtCPK23: low Ca2+-sensitivity.

Experimental Approach: Development of CDPK-FRET Reporters Genetically encoded FRET biosensor (CPKaleon) created to detect Ca2+-dependent conformational changes in CDPKs.

Experimental Framework and Approach GnCDPK purified from dry groundnut seeds, previously characterized for MLCpep (chicken smooth muscle myosin light chain peptide) phosphorylation. Autophosphorylation analyzed under various conditions: Ca2+ dependence (K₀.₅ = 0.5 μM). Mg2+ requirement (5-10 mM). Calmodulin (CaM) independence. Used 32P labeling to detect phosphorylation levels and stoichiometry. 2. Cool Findings GnCDPK autophosphorylates in a Ca2+-dependent but calmodulin-independent manner, inhibited by EGTA. Autophosphorylation occurs primarily on Thr residues, while MLCpep phosphorylation favors Ser. Autophosphorylation reaches saturation within 2 minutes, with a stoichiometry of ~0.2 mol phosphate/mol protein — similar to soybean CDPK. Distinct ATP affinities: Autophosphorylation Km = 100 nM. Exogenous substrate phosphorylation Km = 10 μM — 100x lower affinity for ATP during substrate phosphorylation! Prior autophosphorylation eliminates the lag observed in substrate phosphorylation under low ATP conditions. Lag phase in substrate phosphorylation: Without prior autophosphorylation, a 1-2 min lag is observed at low ATP (5 μM). Pre-incubation with ATP (1 μM, 2-10 min) removes lag, boosting initial substrate phosphorylation rate. 3. Inspiration and Analytical Approaches To determine intra- vs. inter-molecular autophosphorylation: Linear relationship between rate of autophosphorylation and enzyme concentration implies intramolecular (cis) autophosphorylation. Van’t Hoff plot (log velocity vs. log enzyme concentration). Phospho-amino acid analysis: Confirmed pThr for autoP, pSer for substrate P. 32P incorporation measurement via liquid scintillation counting — (RD: could adopt this technique too!). 4. Key Mechanistic Insights Autophosphorylation primes GnCDPK, enhancing its substrate phosphorylation without altering Ca2+ dependency or ATP affinity.

Experimental Framework and Approach GnCDPK purified from dry groundnut seeds, previously characterized for MLCpep (chicken smooth muscle myosin light chain peptide) phosphorylation. Autophosphorylation analyzed under various conditions: Ca2+ dependence (K₀.₅ = 0.5 μM). Mg2+ requirement (5-10 mM). Calmodulin (CaM) independence. Used 32P labeling to detect phosphorylation levels and stoichiometry. 2. Cool Findings GnCDPK autophosphorylates in a Ca2+-dependent but calmodulin-independent manner, inhibited by EGTA. Autophosphorylation occurs primarily on Thr residues, while MLCpep phosphorylation favors Ser. Autophosphorylation reaches saturation within 2 minutes, with a stoichiometry of ~0.2 mol phosphate/mol protein — similar to soybean CDPK. Distinct ATP affinities: Autophosphorylation Km = 100 nM. Exogenous substrate phosphorylation Km = 10 μM — 100x lower affinity for ATP during substrate phosphorylation! Prior autophosphorylation eliminates the lag observed in substrate phosphorylation under low ATP conditions. Lag phase in substrate phosphorylation: Without prior autophosphorylation, a 1-2 min lag is observed at low ATP (5 μM). Pre-incubation with ATP (1 μM, 2-10 min) removes lag, boosting initial substrate phosphorylation rate. 3. Inspiration and Analytical Approaches To determine intra- vs. inter-molecular autophosphorylation: Linear relationship between rate of autophosphorylation and enzyme concentration implies intramolecular (cis) autophosphorylation. Van’t Hoff plot (log velocity vs. log enzyme concentration). Phospho-amino acid analysis: Confirmed pThr for autoP, pSer for substrate P. 32P incorporation measurement via liquid scintillation counting — (RD: could adopt this technique too!). 4.

The review provides detailed insights into kalirin structure, function, disease associations, and therapeutic potential. 1. KALRN Structure and Domain Architecture Domain Function SEC14P (Sec14-like) Lipid-binding domain; drives de novo spine formation, scaffolding, and Rac-GEF activation for synaptic plasticity. Spectrin repeats Short helical scaffolding units, facilitating multiple protein-protein interactions. SH3 domain Mediates intramolecular interactions, potentially regulating kalirin activity. 2. Alternative Splicing and Promoter Usage Alternative splicing and promoter usage lead to distinct KALRN isoforms: Isoform-specific domain architecture. Distinct sets of domains, altering function and localization. N-terminal extensions via alternative promoters alter lipid-binding and cellular targeting. Functional consequences of isoform diversity: Subcellular targeting. Regulatory mechanisms. Interacting partners. Developmental stage-specific expression. Expression patterns vary across brain regions and developmental stages. Isoform diversity provides functional specialization within the synaptic signaling network.\n3. Molecular Mechanisms of Kalirin Function Kalirin as a synaptic scaffold: Organizes molecular machinery for spine morphogenesis and maintenance. Acts as a Rac-GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor): Activates Rho GTPases (like Rac1) for cytoskeletal remodeling. SEC14P domain functions: Drives spine formation. Regulates Rac-GEF activity. Scaffold role for shaping spine morphology. 4. Kalirin and Neurological Diseases Disorder Link to KALRN Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Dysregulated KALRN expression linked to synaptic dysfunction. Schizophrenia Kalirin mutations affect dendritic spine structure and synaptic signaling. Alzheimer’s Disease Kalirin involved in synaptic loss and cognitive impairment. Addiction Altered KALRN expression affects synaptic plasticity related to addiction pathways. Intellectual Disabilities Linked to abnormal spine morphology and synaptic defects. Human genetics: GWAS, exome sequencing, and post-mortem studies link KALRN mutations to disease.

Genetic and molecular evidence highlight normal KALRN expression as crucial for healthy neurodevelopment. The review provides detailed insights into kalirin structure, function, disease associations, and therapeutic potential. 1. KALRN Structure and Domain Architecture Domain Function SEC14P (Sec14-like) Lipid-binding domain; drives de novo spine formation, scaffolding, and Rac-GEF activation for synaptic plasticity. Spectrin repeats Short helical scaffolding units, facilitating multiple protein-protein interactions. SH3 domain Mediates intramolecular interactions, potentially regulating kalirin activity. 2. Alternative Splicing and Promoter Usage Alternative splicing and promoter usage lead to distinct KALRN isoforms: Isoform-specific domain architecture. Distinct sets of domains, altering function and localization. N-terminal extensions via alternative promoters alter lipid-binding and cellular targeting. Functional consequences of isoform diversity: Subcellular targeting. Regulatory mechanisms. Interacting partners. Developmental stage-specific expression. Expression patterns vary across brain regions and developmental stages. Isoform diversity provides functional specialization within the synaptic signaling network.\n3. Molecular Mechanisms of Kalirin Function Kalirin as a synaptic scaffold: Organizes molecular machinery for spine morphogenesis and maintenance. Acts as a Rac-GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor): Activates Rho GTPases (like Rac1) for cytoskeletal remodeling. SEC14P domain functions: Drives spine formation. Regulates Rac-GEF activity. Scaffold role for shaping spine morphology. 4. Kalirin and Neurological Diseases Disorder Link to KALRN Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Dysregulated KALRN expression linked to synaptic dysfunction. Schizophrenia Kalirin mutations affect dendritic spine structure and synaptic signaling. Alzheimer’s Disease Kalirin involved in synaptic loss and cognitive impairment. Addiction Altered KALRN expression affects synaptic plasticity related to addiction pathways. Intellectual Disabilities Linked to abnormal spine morphology and synaptic defects. Human genetics: GWAS, exome sequencing, and post-mortem studies link KALRN mutations to disease. Animal models: KALRN-deficient mice exhibit behavioral and synaptic deficits, modeling human disease phenotypes. 5. Therapeutic Implications \u0026amp; Pharmacology Emerging therapeutic approaches target kalirin modulation to correct synaptic defects. Potential to pharmacologically regulate kalirin activity for treating synaptopathies. Future directions: Small molecules to modulate GEF activity. Isoform-specific modulation to fine-tune synapse-specific signaling. Targeting protein-protein interactions mediated by spectrin or SH3 domains. 6. Interesting Insights / Inspiration SEC14P domain multifunctionality: lipid binding, scaffolding, Rac-GEF control — versatile synaptic regulator. Spectrin repeats: repeated helical motifs enable complex protein interaction networks, may relate to coiled-coil structures (possible link to Crick’s coiled-coil model?). SH3 domain: possible regulator of intramolecular autoinhibition, affecting kalirin activation. Alternative splicing/promoter usage: Generates isoforms with different lipid affinities and cellular roles. Mechanism to dynamically modulate synaptic localization and function. Disease link to developmental timing and brain region-specific KALRN isoform expression. KALRN as a model for understanding synaptic GEFs in disease. Idea for therapeutics: modulate kalirin to restore spine density and plasticity in neurodevelopmental disorders. RD’s Reflections Very intriguing link between kalirin\u0026rsquo;s domain architecture and its multifunctional roles in synaptic regulation. Alternative splicing adds an unexpected level of complexity — dynamic control over domain presence and function. Potential model for other synaptic scaffolds/GEFs — could these mechanisms be conserved in other neuronal regulators? Kalirin dysfunction connects cytoskeletal regulation to neuropsychiatric disorders — a very rich area for therapeutic exploration.

Anatomy of a Protein Kinase Glycine loop (156-161; 4ekk): organizes γ-phosphate for phosphoryl transfer. αD helix (233-242; 4ekk) \u0026amp; Activation loop (294-306; 4ekk): substrate binding and recognition. αG helix (352-363; 4ekk): mediates protein-protein interactions (e.g., dimerization, trans-inhibition, substrate recognition). Active conformation requires hydrophobic spines (C-spine \u0026amp; R-spine) and a conserved salt bridge (β3-lysine \u0026amp; αC-glutamate). Activation loop: site of phosphorylation, highest divergence, and flexibility. 2. Kinase Regulation Concepts Inactive and active states modulated by cis (intramolecular) and trans (intermolecular) regulatory mechanisms. Activation loop phosphorylation is pivotal — but mechanism (cis vs. trans) remains debated. Steric occlusion: substrate site blocked in cis (e.g., CaMKK, PKA) or trans (e.g., DAPK dimers). Allostery: distal interactions modulating activity — in both cis and trans. Regulation via disorder-to-order transitions in activation loops is a key feature in many kinases (e.g., PKB). 3. Kinase Inhibition and Activation Inhibition Activation loop occlusion: prevents substrate and ATP binding (e.g., RTKs, Src). Steric block by inhibitory elements (cis: C-terminal helix in CaMKK; trans: DAPK dimer). 14-3-3 proteins interacting with B-raf C-terminal to prevent activation. Activation C-terminal extensions in AGC kinases stabilize active conformations via cis-interactions. Aurora kinases and others regulated by C-terminal motifs and activation loop phosphorylation. Activation loop phosphorylation in trans: dimerization enables cross-phosphorylation (e.g., PDK1 on PIP3 membranes). Potential for cis-autophosphorylation: proposed in PKD but controversial. 4. Cis vs. Trans Autophosphorylation Mechanisms Trans-autophosphorylation: bimolecular, concentration-dependent, often via face-to-face dimerization. Cis-autophosphorylation: unimolecular, concentration-independent, occurring within the same molecule. The mechanism remains enigmatic as phosphorylation requires kinase activity prior to its own activation loop phosphorylation. 5. Interpreting Biochemical Evidence Techniques: Intact Mass Spectrometry: precise, but lacks site specificity. Tandem MS: site-specific, but peptide ionization and cleavage issues. Radionuclide assays and phospho-specific Western blots: semi-quantitative, limited specificity. Interpretation: Concentration-dependent activity → supports trans-mechanism but non-definitive. Figure: a pic from the paper for clarifying. (Click to enlarge)\rMutational analysis of dimer interfaces can suggest dimerization roles but has pitfalls due to overlapping cis/trans interfaces. Multiple converging evidence streams required to distinguish cis and trans clearly. 6. Kinetic Models of Autophosphorylation Cis: unimolecular, linear product formation, concentration-independent. Trans: bimolecular, concentration-dependent, requires partner interaction. Dimerization scenarios: transient (weak, signal-induced) vs. constitutive dimers (stable). 7. Structural Evidence and Its Ambiguities Crystal structures show dimerization but may reflect lattice artifacts driven by activation loop exchange. Activation loop docking in trans can promote crystal growth, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t confirm physiological relevance. Interpretation of crystal dimers requires solution validation (e.g., crosslinking, NMR, SAXS). Example: Chk2 activation loop exchange forming crystal lattice dimers — but physiological relevance unclear. 8. The Enigma of Activation Loop Autophosphorylation Logical problem: kinase needs activity to phosphorylate its own loop before it becomes active. Autophosphorylation mechanistically distinct from substrate phosphorylation — supported by evidence that canonical substrate motif mutations don’t affect autophosphorylation (e.g., PKD). Autophosphorylation motifs often non-canonical — not phosphorylated as peptides in trans. Physiological constraints: low cellular kinase concentrations (nM), crowded environments — challenging for purely diffusion-limited trans autophosphorylation. Autophosphorylation may require scaffolds, localization, or induced dimerization to occur efficiently in cells. RD\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts and Learnings Strong conceptual framework but mechanistic gaps remain for cis vs. trans activation loop phosphorylation. Structural ambiguity of activation loop dimers in crystal structures is a real issue — needs careful biochemical and biophysical validation. Exciting but perplexing: kinase needs to be active to autophosphorylate — yet phosphorylation often activates the kinase. A chicken-or-egg paradox in molecular biology. Important reminder that in vitro biochemistry must be interpreted with caution, especially regarding physiological relevance of dimerization and activation mechanisms.

Distal docking and substrate recognition extend beyond consensus sites—highlighting the holistic nature of kinase-substrate interactions. RD\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts and Learnings RD finds this paper deeply inspiring—dense but elegant in laying out the catalytic logic of kinases. The role of Asp166 as a \u0026ldquo;non-classical\u0026rdquo; catalyst makes RD think more about transition states than simple acid/base chemistry. Metal ion interplay and activation loop behavior remind RD of allosteric enzyme models—worth exploring more via QM/MM and kinetic modeling. RD loves the idea of connecting distant structural changes to catalytic output—perfect for future studies on kinase regulation and phosphorylation dynamics. To-Do/Future Ideas Explore QM/MM modeling of PKA catalysis. Deep dive into activation loop disorder-order transitions across kinase families. Study metal ion-dependent activity modulation in diverse kinases (TPKs, CSK). Examine rate-determining steps using rapid quench flow data and kinetic modeling. I LOVE THIS PAPER! 💙\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/zh/posts_zh/%E7%95%8C%E9%99%90%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%96/87/","summary":"Comprehensive notes on the 2001 Chemical Reviews paper exploring the catalytic and kinetic mechanisms of protein kinases, with PKA as a model system.

But for me, CK3 is not just a strategy game. It\u0026rsquo;s a sandbox for chaos, a place where history, power, and human flaws collide in ways no other game can replicate.\nWhy CK3? When life gets overwhelming, some people read books, some people go hiking — I start a dynasty in CK3.\nI think what makes CK3 different is that you never fully \u0026ldquo;control\u0026rdquo; your story. You might start as a powerful queen, but within two generations, your dynasty could be split by succession wars, assassinated by angry vassals, or reduced to a minor count.\nAnd I love that.\n\u0026ldquo;Life is unpredictable, and so is CK3.\u0026rdquo;\nIt mirrors reality: no matter how much you plan, things fall apart, alliances break, and sometimes, just sometimes, something beautiful emerges from the chaos.\nMy Favorite Playstyle: From Countess to Empress I like starting small — as an obscure countess, ruling a forgotten patch of land on the edge of the map.\nBecause building from nothing makes every success feel earned.\nHere’s a typical progression I enjoy:\nStart as a lone woman in a world dominated by powerful kings. Survive: first goal is simply to avoid being crushed — make alliances, marry strategically, and make sure my heir is competent. Expand carefully: take over neighboring counties through clever marriages or fabricated claims. Balance vassals: when you become a duchess, suddenly everyone wants to take your land — so learning how to \u0026ldquo;smile while planning their downfall\u0026rdquo; is essential. Eventually, rise to Queen or Empress — but by then, managing a huge kingdom with rebellious dukes is a whole new kind of game. There’s something deeply satisfying about turning a vulnerable countess into a powerful empress — and doing it not just with swords, but with words, marriages, and schemes.\nThe Chaos Moments — Why I Love This Game CK3 is full of \u0026ldquo;wait, did that just happen?\u0026rdquo; moments.\nSome of my favorites:\nMy husband accidentally assassinated my heir (because I forgot to cancel a murder scheme when we made up — classic CK3 mistake). My character being seduced by her worst rival, and the resulting secret child nearly tearing the kingdom apart. Surviving a peasant uprising only to be excommunicated by the Pope for \u0026ldquo;immorality\u0026rdquo; (okay, maybe I did seduce a few people for alliances\u0026hellip;). Grandson who inherited everything turning out to be a lunatic cannibal, and realizing I had to \u0026ldquo;accidentally\u0026rdquo; arrange his hunting trip to a bear-infested forest\u0026hellip; These aren\u0026rsquo;t just game events — they become stories I carry with me, almost like memories from another life.\nWhat CK3 Teaches Me About Life Strangely, CK3 feels like a life simulator sometimes.\nYou learn:\nPatience: things take generations to build. Resilience: even when you lose everything, you can rebuild. Adaptability: sometimes, the world throws impossible situations — you have to adapt. Letting go: not every heir will be perfect; sometimes you just roll with what fate gives you. \u0026ldquo;In CK3, like in life, we plan, and then fate intervenes.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy I Keep Playing Even after hundreds of hours, CK3 still feels fresh. Every new character, every new dynasty, creates a whole new story.\nSometimes it’s about love and betrayal, sometimes war and conquest, sometimes faith and heresy.\nAnd perhaps, when life feels out of control, controlling a medieval dynasty — even as it falls apart — makes me feel a little more grounded.\n\u0026ldquo;We live, we scheme, we die — but our dynasty endures.\u0026rdquo;\nTags: Crusader Kings 3, CK3, Strategy, Medieval, Life Lessons\nCategory: Life \u0026gt; Games\n","permalink":"https://ruoqi28.github.io/en/en/posts/life/game-log/ck3/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;ve ever dreamed of \u003cstrong\u003ebeing a medieval queen or king\u003c/strong\u003e, plotting the downfall of enemies, surviving political intrigue, or marrying off relatives to secure alliances — \u003cstrong\u003eCrusader Kings III (CK3)\u003c/strong\u003e is the ultimate stage to live out those dreams.

you choose.\nBut what really surprised me was how much story and character development there is.\nEvery time you die (and you die a lot — it’s a roguelike after all), the story moves forward.\nYou get new conversations with characters like Zagreus, Hades, Nyx, and the Olympian gods, and slowly piece together why Zagreus is trying to escape the Underworld.\nGreek Mythology, but Fresh One of the best parts of Hades is how it brings Greek mythology to life — but in a way that feels modern.\nThe gods are funny, flawed, and complicated, and your relationships with them evolve as you play.\nUnlike some games that just \u0026ldquo;borrow\u0026rdquo; mythology as a setting, Hades really makes you feel like you are part of that world.\nThe Cycle of Trying and Failing (and Growing) Because it’s a roguelike, Hades is about trying, failing, and trying again.\nBut unlike other roguelikes that focus just on skill, Hades makes every run meaningful because you learn more about Zagreus, his family, and even yourself.\nThere’s a constant sense of progress — not just in terms of power-ups, but in the story and characters.\nI think that’s why Hades feels so \u0026ldquo;personal\u0026rdquo; — even though it’s an action game, it reflects something very human: struggling, learning, and moving forward.\nFinal Thoughts Hades is one of the best combinations of action and story I’ve seen.\nIt’s fun to play, but also emotionally deep, with themes about family, identity, and resilience.\nIf you like games that challenge both your reflexes and your mind, I highly recommend it.\nAlso, the soundtrack is amazing.\nTags: Hades, Indie Games, Roguelike, Greek Mythology, Narrative\nCategory: Life \u0026gt;
