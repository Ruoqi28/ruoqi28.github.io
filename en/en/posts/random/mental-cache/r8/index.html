It said that under digital capitalism and social media, we are gradually entering a society characterized by homogenization, self-replication, and information overload.\n“In this society, the true ‘Other’—the one who is different from us, the one capable of shaking our thoughts and challenging our perspectives—is disappearing.”\nThat idea was very interesting.\nDuring the days of push and pull with ZGY, I thought a lot and became more and more confused—why does this person attract me so much? Logically, it doesn’t make sense. But in trying to understand, I imagined spending a lifetime with him. Marriage, all of it.\nAnd in that moment of thinking, I was surprised to realize—I am an existentialist, maybe even an optimistic one.\nBecause of the distance.\nBecause of overthinking.\nBecause of arguments.\nBecause even after the arguments, he still stayed in my mind and heart.\nBecause he was in my mind and heart, I wanted to be certain.\nAnd the more I wanted to be certain, the more I marveled at the existence of this feeling.\nThere were times—during arguments—when I just wanted to be free.\nI told him again and again:\n“Then say it.

    <div class="post-content"><p>I once read a book written by a Korean author. It said that under digital capitalism and social media, we are gradually entering a society characterized by homogenization, self-replication, and information overload.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In this society, the true ‘Other’—the one who is different from us, the one capable of shaking our thoughts and challenging our perspectives—is disappearing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That idea was very interesting.</p>
<p>During the days of push and pull with ZGY, I thought a lot and became more and more confused—why does this person attract me so much? Logically, it doesn’t make sense. But in trying to understand, I imagined spending a lifetime with him. Marriage, all of it.</p>
<p>And in that moment of thinking, I was surprised to realize—I am an existentialist, maybe even an optimistic one.</p>
<p>Because of the distance.<br>
Because of overthinking.<br>
Because of arguments.<br>
Because even after the arguments, he still stayed in my mind and heart.<br>
Because he was in my mind and heart, I wanted to be certain.<br>
And the more I wanted to be certain, the more I marveled at the existence of this feeling.</p>
<p>There were times—during arguments—when I just wanted to be free.<br>
I told him again and again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Then say it. Say you don’t love me. Say it so I can leave.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I was so ready to let go, if only he would give me that one clear answer.</p>
<p>But he wouldn’t.<br>
He couldn’t.</p>
<p>On the phone, I imagined him sitting with his head in his hands, silent for a long time.<br>
And then, barely audible—almost like he was talking to himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No. I love.”<br>
“I love.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Over and over again, every time I asked.<br>
Calm. Certain. Like fact.</p>
<p>And in those moments, I realized—love itself may not be entirely rational, but choosing to love, choosing how to love, is my freedom.</p>
<p>I realized, I wholeheartedly agreed with Sartre and even came to like him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The self is nothing more than the interpretation we give to the facts about us—and that interpretation is always changing.”<br>
— Jean-Paul Sartre, <em>Being and Nothingness</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sartre criticized the idea that the self is simply something that exists. He called it self-deception—a refusal to take personal responsibility, an attempt to claim that life is dictated by factuality, using it as an excuse to escape the responsibility of who you are and who you will become.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are our choices.”<br>
— Jean-Paul Sartre</p></blockquote>
<p>It is the denial of your duty to create yourself, a surrender before even trying.</p>
<p>But the existentialist me wants to create the future me.</p>
<p>And then, I started wondering—what if fate isn’t a straight line?<br>
What if fate is a circle? A loop?<br>
What if time is not pushing us forward, but folding back on itself—and in that spiral, we meet the same people again and again, and the choices we make begin to feel like destiny?</p>
<p>ZGY is not fate in the conventional sense. He was a coincidence—at first.<br>
But I chose him.<br>
And maybe I’ve chosen him so many times—across so many loops—that now he feels inevitable.</p>
<p>I murmured to myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Fate at first glance. Every glance after—still fate.”</p></blockquote>
<p>From nineteen to twenty-eight.<br>
I don’t know. Maybe I’ve always known.<br>
Maybe that’s the problem.</p>
<p>So no—he wasn’t fate when we met.<br>
But he became my fate, because I keep choosing him.</p>
<p>So, love is my choice.<br>
And because it is a choice I keep making, again and again, it becomes my freedom.<br>
And it becomes my fate.</p>
<p>Maybe fate is just a memory from the future.</p>
<p>I don’t know, it’s kind of amazing.<br>
I have found—or perhaps created—a new version of myself.<br>
ZGY was the catalyst.<br>
Or maybe evolution.<br>
Or maybe a message sent backward from the self I am becoming.</p>
<p>Of course, my animal instincts.<br>
But also my metaphysics.</p>
<p>So I love you.</p>
<p>Among so many people, I only want to hold you, kiss you, and form a deeper bond with you.</p>
<p>So—if time is a circle, then you are my freedom.<br>
And you are my fate.</p>
