      <description>Notes on 2013 PNAS paper introducing the role of charge distribution pattern (κ) in shaping IDP conformations. Highlights how linear charge segregation influences whether IDPs adopt random coil or compact, hairpin-like structures.</description>

      <title>Single-Molecule Spectroscopy Reveals Polymer Effects of Disordered Proteins in Crowded Environments</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/en/en/posts/mind/mindscape/82/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/en/en/posts/mind/mindscape/82/</guid>
      <description>Notes on the 2014 PNAS paper using single-molecule FRET to analyze the conformational response of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to molecular crowding. Highlights how IDP compaction depends not only on crowder concentration but also on crowder size, challenging traditional crowding models and introducing polymer-specific effects.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Hidden Sensitivity of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins to Their Chemical Environments</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/en/en/posts/mind/mindscape/81/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/en/en/posts/mind/mindscape/81/</guid>
      <description>Notes on the 2020 ACS paper introducing a combined experimental, computational, and analytical framework to study how IDRs respond to changes in chemical environments. The work reveals sequence-dependent compaction and expansion of IDRs under different solutes and highlights the role of chemical sensitivity as an added layer of regulation in biology.</description>
